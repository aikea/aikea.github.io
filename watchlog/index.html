I really needed to hear that right now. This is a documentary about Fred Rogers, a minister-to-be from Pittsburg, who by a turn of events got into television which was booming in the 60s. He wrote, produced, and directed <em>&ldquo;Mr. Rogers&rsquo; Neighborhood</em>&rdquo;, a TV program directed at young children. Mr. Rogers&rsquo; incredible understanding of child psychology coupled with his minsiterial training allowed him to present really sensitive issues like death, validation, and even divorce to young children. I really, really enjoyed getting to know this ambitious and noble man.

It chronicles the ups and downs in the relationship of a 25yr old girl with a 15yr old boy and follows both as they seek out their meaning and place in life, the boy involved in petty teenage activities while the girl matured and more pragmatic in her approach to life. Their huge age difference formed a major factor as to how they approached their relationship and most of the movie revolved how they &ldquo;worked it out&rdquo;. Relatively sparse, quirky events, and a tad bit long, I felt it was a movie designed to pass time.

Directed by the brilliant Coen brothers, it&rsquo;s a fictional story of a inept car sales manager who pays a couple of henchmen to kidnap his wife in order to exhort money from his miser father-in-law. However, things go awry and end up pretty badly for everyone. Superb storytelling, that Minnesota accent, the stark white settings, and <em>Mike Yanagita</em> makes this a movie truly deserving of being included in many &ldquo;Best movies of all times&rdquo; lists. There are also subtle many subtle references to Alfred Htitchcock and Stanley Kubrick among others.

I want to kick myself for delaying this gem of a movie for <em>this</em> long. In this movie, Kon tells a romance story in his style, bringing together drama, love, poignance, piquing our interest, keeping us arrested in the disorienting whirlwind that is his <em>modus operandi</em>. There is chaos and yet, it doesn&rsquo;t feel chaotic. The blurry line between reality and imagination is a recurring theme in all of Kon&rsquo;s works and in this, it outshines. As Chiyoko remarks at the end, “After all, what I really love is the pursuit of him”, we are forced to rethink the basis of our affection. (first watch: Jun 12, 2022)</p><ol start=34><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Platform | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | 2019</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>A deeply metaphorical, introspective study of capitalism, exisiting societal structures, and the human nature.

From the writing down to each individual shot, it exudes a sense of artistic appreciation in the executor. Paced and balanced story, had a tough time deciphering the Southern accent (lol), nice soundtrack, great dialogues. Overall, ~justified of being in Ebert&rsquo;s Best Movies list~ a good watch.
(first watch: Jun 23, 2022)</p><ol start=36><li><blockquote><p><strong>Scott Pilgrim vs the World | Edgar Wright | 2010</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>How do I even begin to describe this cherry of a movie? Imagine someone mixed video games, rock music, and a love story together. The plot, the execution, the brilliant cinematography, the creative editing (which I highly approve of), this movie speaks for something beyond its age. It&rsquo;s a weird movie, no doubt. But in a good way. And that is the best kind of weird, really.
So, the story follows this skinny Canadian boy called Scott Pilgrim who&rsquo;s reeling from past breakup and own problems when he meets Ramona Flowers, an American hipster and instantly falls in love with her. But he must defeat every member of the League of Evil Exes to get to be with her. It&rsquo;s the kind of boy-meet-girl, fall-in-love, can&rsquo;t-be-together, fight-against-all-odds, now-together, happy ending, reimagined.
And, the characters OMG! (And Mary Elizabeth&rsquo;s Ramona is so hot (LOL))
PS: There are seven of Ramona&rsquo;s exes.
PPS: Every teenager should watch this movie atleast once!
PPPS: And why only teenagers? (OK, I&rsquo;m too excited but it&rsquo;s a good movie, I can&rsquo;t help it. Ok, bye)
(first watch: Jun 26, 2022)</p><ol start=37><li><blockquote><p><strong>Heat | Micheal Mann | 1995</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>Set in LA, <em>Heat</em> is the classic police-and-theif chase story with a heart. Follows Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro) as he crafts master plans to rob banks, and execute dissidents, manage a personal life, etc. with Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a LAPD Homicide officer on his tail. It&rsquo;s a great movie on so many levels. Great writing, cinematography, acting. It managed to keep me at the edge of my seat till 3:30 AM (LOL). Great movie for a Saturday night with friends.
(first watch: Jun 27, 2022)</p><ol start=38><li><blockquote><p><strong>Lost and Delirious | Leo Pool | 2001</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>The story follows two teenager girls who are in love with each other but then one decides to act on the <em>&ldquo;log kya kahenge&rdquo;</em> narrative which leaves the other girl distraught. The movie essentially explores the intense disheaval and delirium that the lose of a lover can bring. I think the writing was disbalanced because the characters weren&rsquo;t realised to their full potential (For eg: the head mistress and her side-kick). I can imagine that it must have been &ldquo;blasphemous&rdquo; for a 2K1 audience for it does have few &ldquo;bold&rdquo; scenes. Also have to mention that Indian song/composition by Yves Chamberland which seems so out of place. Since it is unnamed, I couldn&rsquo;t find translation for the lyrics which is so sad. Yes, now I&rsquo;m gonna go and read Macbeth :P
PS: It doesn&rsquo;t end well.
PPS: Yes, this is me celebrating pride month at the end because exams 😢
(first watch: Jun 30, 2022)</p><ol start=39><li><blockquote><p><strong>Mad Max: Fury Road | George Miller | 2015</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>This is <em>the</em> definition of action-packed. Amazing movie from all respects. Loved it. Can rewatch anytime. No breakthorughs in terms of technique or cinematography but exceptional usage of existing ones. Brilliant writing of course, and editing. Now I know what the hype is all about. Again, couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it (!)
(first watch: July 2nd, 2022)</p><ol start=40><li><blockquote><p><strong>American Psycho | Mary Harron | 2000</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p><em>American Psycho</em> is a open-ended, metaphorical study of the American capitalist mindset. It takes the idea of the quintessential Wall Street banker and stretches that to its extreme. It is beyond doubt that this movie counts among the finest of modern cult classics. The suspense, the drama, the sheer terror of it all, the constant pinging question of the fate of the next person Patrick Bateman would meet. Bateman stands in the company of the finest villains such as Anton Chigurh, John Doe, and Hannibal Lecter. His presence in the frame itself is terrifying and to achieve such effect requires a mastery of the craft. I admit that the ending is ambigous. We never know if it was Bateman&rsquo;s imagination or for real but I think that makes sense because in the high-class, ultra-rich American bourgeois circles, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. We see that detective Kimball was unable to link any of the murders back to Bateman and just to add to your annoyance, <em>none</em> of the &ldquo;murders&rdquo; committed by Patrick were seen by other people on screen. So, is Bateman the metaphorical representation of the American rich dog who is above law and order and can get away with any crime, no matter how heinous or is he the representation of the over-clocked American workman who has lost it under anxiety and tension?
I watched this with a friend and totally enjoyed it. Brilliant cinematography for eg: the casual shot of Bateman opening his refrigerator door to reveal a severed female head wrapped in plastic or the stored dead female bodies in his closet. It&rsquo;s how quickly Harron was able to escalate situations that makes this movie a super edgy watch.
(first watch: July 2nd 2022)</p><ol start=41><li><blockquote><p><strong>Pitch Perfect | Jason Moore | 2012</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>A modern musical based on the A Capella style of music making.

I really should have read the book :P They mean well when they say read the classics. One would actually want to live with the March sisters as they go about their business. Each sister is so well developed as a character and Alcott diversifed so well that every teenage girl, irrespective of their era, would be able to identify themselves with one of them. Love the conflict in Jo March&rsquo;s character. &ldquo;I want to be great, or nothing&rdquo; is so well-spoken. And then you have, &ldquo;Writing doesn&rsquo;t confer importance, it reflects it&rdquo;. Cherry of a movie. Definitely watchable with kids around.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)</p><ol start=44><li><blockquote><p><strong>Blue is the Warmest Color | Abdellatif Kechiche | 2013</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>Ok. I can understand now what the protests were all about when this came out 9 years ago. The male director <em>does</em> seem to border on fetishizing lesbians. Other than that, I think it&rsquo;s a great movie nevertheless, although a tad too long.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)</p><ol start=45><li><blockquote><p><strong>District 9 | Neill Blomkamp | 2009</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>Entertaining.

It&rsquo;s so weird and cringey and unfinished. So, basically, a group of homosexuals are sent to a therapy school called &lsquo;True Directions&rsquo; which is headed by a hot-headed (read: humorous) headmistress Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) who believes in the simple &ldquo;five step&rdquo; solution to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; homosexuality as if it&rsquo;s a disease. Very cringey writing, humorous and memorable characters. Overall, a funny movie.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 18th, 2022)</p><ol start=47><li><blockquote><p><strong>Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness | Sam Raimi | 2022</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>I expect MCU to deliver monotonuous, cookie-cutter, feel-good movies and it never disappoints.

A man who lost his mother at a young age and misses dearly, he is the antithesis of what he projects on the outside, when he&rsquo;s alone. The plot follows him and Alma Elson, an indomitable local waitress as they fall in love despite their differences and is beautifully told. There are some innovative camera shots in this movie.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 20th, 2022)</p><ol start=49><li><blockquote><p><strong>Arrival | Denis Villeneuve | 2016</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p><em>Arrival</em> is Ted Chiang&rsquo;s novella &ldquo;Story of your life&rdquo; adapted for the screen. Told in a non-linear chronological order by a Dr. Louise Banks, an accomplished linguist as she recalls events of the past and yet something of her manner of talking is disconcerting. She talks in &ldquo;You&rsquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&rdquo; as if she&rsquo;s <em>already</em> aware of what will happen. And indeed, the movie explores the themes of determinism, free-will, and eventually Cassandra complex in the behaviour of its protagonist, Louise. There is ample food for thought to the budding linguists in the language and its consequent decipherment of the &ldquo;Heptapods&rdquo; - the creatures who arrived. Amazing perfomances by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner (playing Dr. Ian Donnelly) alongwith brilliant direction from Villeneuve who is known for masterfully directing thrillers. Coherent and wholesome.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)</p><ol start=50><li><blockquote><p><strong>Inglorious Basterds | Quentin Tarantino | 2009</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>By style and execution, this is a Tarantino all the way down (The skillfully directed strudel scene with Landa and Shoshanna in a confrontational ballet (contrary to the popular opinion of the opening chapter which is still great nevertheless)). Divided into chapters, it tells the fictional story of a group of Jewish-American-Italian rebel group that goes about terrorizing the Nazis of occupied France and the chase by Herr Hans Landa, an SS officer and the main antagonist of the movie. <em>Basterds</em> lacked the chaotic harmony of <em>Pulp fiction</em> where Tarantino masterfully weaved multiple plots and storyline into a cohesive whole. In that respect, <em>Basterds</em> is a less ambitious ordeal. But let that not fool you from the exceptional cinematography and brilliant shots and compositions that once again proves Tarantino as a master of his art (Cue in the shot of a hesitant Shoshanna resting against a huge window). The characters of Landa and Adolf Hilter himself, written in their incredulously humorous and dumb-witted fashion, were reminiscient of Taika Waititi&rsquo;s another great movie, <em>Jojo Rabbit</em>. Great anti-war story with humour but I presume that is only to counter the explicit gore and violence that is one of Tarantino&rsquo;s regular motifs.</p><p>(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)</p><ol start=51><li><blockquote><p><strong>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaara | Zoya Akhtar | 2011</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>This.

One of those few pieces of art that makes you want to leave everything behind, pack your bags, and just head out. Kerouac&rsquo;s <em>On the Road</em> made me feel this way too. Definitely rewatchable!</p><p>(first watch: Jul 23rd, 2022)</p><ol start=52><li><blockquote><p><strong>Rashomon | Akira Kurosawa | 1950</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>My introduction to Kurosawa. <em>Rashomon</em> is quite an accessible piece among his works. Loved it for the vivid emotions and the residual influence of silent films. That iconic &ldquo;woodcutter walking into the forest&rdquo; scene is visual pleasure for the cinephile. And I suppose there is enough said and analysed about the meaning of the plot, the puzzle of the &ldquo;true&rdquo; murderer, and the nature of objective truth and human psychology itself. In ~88 minutes, Akira Kurosawa takes us into a world bordering on the mystic and supernatural and shows us the power of ingenious cinematography, camera movements, and clever editing.

Cuts to a livid and bustling Parisian avenue in the daylight as the camera follows a man who follows and slaps another man.<em>&ldquo;CUT!&rdquo;</em> and we snap back to reality – a scene was shot. <em>Day for Night</em>, which borrows its name from a filmmaking technique that is used to shoot night scenes in daytime, is a film about films by the acclaimed French New Wave director, Francois Truffaut.</p><p>The rich French culture of appreciation of films as work of art shines through in this visual storytelling that verges on the metaphysical portraiture of making films itself. We follow director Ferrand (Francois Truffuat) as he fends a number of personal and professional problems of himself, the cast, and the crew to shoot a film called <em>&ldquo;Meet Pamela&rdquo;</em> – an adulterous tale in which the hero&rsquo;s fiancee falls in love with his father.</p><p>In a voiceover he rhetorically asks: <strong>&ldquo;What is a director? Someone who&rsquo;s asked endless questions about everything.&rdquo;</strong> and goes on to prove the validity of his answer. The film beautifully captures the multitude of things going wrong, taking unexpected turns, the improvisations, the cast whims, the cast breakdowns, crew management, the logistics, the producer, the studio, and what not. I strongly believe any budding filmmaker should watch this film atleast once.</p><p>What I appreciated was the fact that inspite of all hurdles, Truffaut manages to sneak in the fantasized, dream-like quality of cinema. Be it the bundle of book on filmmaking he got in order or montages of shooting set in beautiful composition accompanied by majestic upbeat music by composer Georges Delerue. He takes pride in his art like an artist in his painting. Ferrand&rsquo;s a restless detective, drawing inspiration from even the mundanities of existence. During the shoot, he improvises words spoken by the lead actress during her personal breakdown and introduced them as dialogues for her character! Or when he steals a blue vase from the hotel because it would fit perfectly in the scene. To be honest, it is difficult to point out where Ferrand ends and where Truffaut begins. A bit mischeivous, a bit crazy.</p><p>Filmmaking is a difficult job and perhaps, the job of the director the hardest.
This movie is a great starting point to begin to understand that.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A director must be a policeman, a midwife, a psychoanalyst, a sycophant, and a bastard.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>~Billy Wender.</p><p>PS: <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/><em>The 400 Blows</em></a> next :P</p><p>(first watch: August 3rd, 2022)</p><ol start=55><li><blockquote><p><strong>Irreversible | Gaspar Noe | 2002</strong></p></blockquote></li></ol><p>Gaspar Noe is known for commenting on sensitive topics via heavily experimental, avant-garde films. In <strong>&ldquo;Irreversible&rdquo;</strong>, he undertakes the task of telling the story of an ugly and horrifying night in the life of a couple in reverse chronological order. We meet <em>Marcus</em>, wild and aggressive, who seems on the verge of a mental collapse, running across the city chasing someone by the name of Tenia. He&rsquo;s <em>the</em> embodiment of aggression and violence: trashing, punching, smashing people&rsquo;s heads. The frames captures raw emotions, a dillusioned Marcus as Noe tries to convey his world collapsing by swirling his camera all over the subject and beyond. The camera movement seems forced and annoying compelling us to empathise with the fact that all is not well in Marcus&rsquo;s life and suddenly, the movements start to feel like poetic. The only point of calmness is his friend, Pierre, who accompanies him through the cacophonic night.</p><p>Marcus&rsquo; girlfriend, Alex, was raped and killed in the subway while Marcus and Pierre were at a party. Alex was fed up by a drunken Marcus and left for home alone. She was suggested to take the subway to cross the road as it was &ldquo;safer&rdquo;. The shocking and terrifying 9 minute long rape scene shook the Cannes audience way back in 2002. And yet, it is so enraging and horrifying to realise that this is how it happens when it does.</p><p>The movie takes a peaceful turn in the second half as Gaspar elucidates the relationship between Alex and Marcus. Their bedroom scene is so pregnant with irony; when Alex vehemantly disagrees to be treated like an object men can pass around; or when she smirks at Pierre, her ex, when asked about her sex life with Marcus. The smirk of a woman who prides herself in the secrets she keeps. Something broke in my heart when she said, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the woman who decides&rdquo;</em>. It is a well-written balance to the first half where Marcus rummages through the wastelands of Paris, through filthy sex clubs, through depraved souls, and through smashing skulls.</p><p>Gaspar Noe learnt everything in film school just to make sure he never uses them. I talked about the camera, floating in space like a spectre. There is a loud wailing noise in the background at all times. The color palatte is dark. We see subjects in glimpses.</p><p>PS: Heavy violence, gore, sexual content. Highly disturbing (like all Noe movies). Watch at your discretion.</p><p>(first watch: 4th August, 2022)</p><ol start=56><li><blockquote><p><strong>The 400 Blows | Francois Truffaut | 1959</strong>
A classic that helped kick-start French New Wave. I loved the story and cinematography. It&rsquo;s a movie that celebrates childhood, Paris, and the audacity to not listen. Loved it really.

<em>Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em> is an American theatrical piece by Edward Albee adapted for the screen. It explores the dysfunctional marriage of a history professor and his infertile, tumoultous wife whilst commenting on other existential issues like facing realities and the nature of illusion and lies.</p></blockquote></li></ol><p>The play is set mostly in George and Martha&rsquo;s house where they receive a young, newly-wed couple, Nick, who is a professor in the Biology Department, and Honey, his &ldquo;slim-hipped&rdquo; wife after a party hosted by Martha&rsquo;s father and head of Institute. The ensuing conversation between these two couples and a number of scandalous, heart-breaking, and vicious events turn the night into a despicable hell-hole. The characters are rich in complexities and multi-layered who can be dissected for a long time and provide ample food for discussion.</p><p>The central piece of the play is George and Martha&rsquo;s marriage and the hundred ways they cannot survive each other and yet surprisingly have stuck together for so long. It&rsquo;s a childless marriage and a truth Marta chooses to hide by conjuring a phantom son who is sixteen years old. George was once an ambitious young man who has a wild childhood, and has failed to achieve much in life eventually to live off his father-in-law&rsquo;s money, a fact Martha cruelly points out and it seems, likes to take pride in. Out of frustration, the couple lacerates each other and their guests in multiple avenues through the night. It is, to say the least, painful to watch. Words turn to acid that dissolves any affection, gestures turned murderous and appalling. George eventually breaks the reality to Martha that is, that they have no children, a fact that seem to finally cap the excited, nymphous middle-aged woman.</p><p>There is love between George and Martha when she, in one of her spontaneous fits, confesses her love for George in a very poignant and deep monologue.</p><blockquote><p>Martha: Whom I will not forgive for having come to rest.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For having seen me and having said &ldquo;Yes, this will do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Who has made the hideous, the hurting the insulting mistake of loving me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And must be punished for it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>~<em>Who&rsquo;s Afriad of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee</em></p></blockquote><p>Virginia Woolf stood as a woman who preferred to face realities instead of living in illusions. Hence, the curious title of the play eventually translates to: &ldquo;Who is afriad of facing realities?&rdquo;, an appropriate title to the play and made more stark when Martha says, &ldquo;I am. I am&rdquo; in her closing lines. It leaves us wondering whether we are afriad of Virginia Woolf too.</p><p>(first watch: 13th August, 2022)</p><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts</h2><p>In any case, this is a curation of the movies I watched this year.</p><p>I would love to hear your thoughts, ideas or suggestions to add to this list!
