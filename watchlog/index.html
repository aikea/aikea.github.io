Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)</p><p>I am a <em>big</em> organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the <em>primary</em> motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning.</p><p><strong>A Tiny Note:</strong> <em>(xN)</em> means I have watched that movie N times. This is not sufficient info, however, to conclude that I have liked that movie proportionately but it is true generally.</p><h2 id=heading>📺</h2><h3 id=2020>2020</h3><ol><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) <em>(x2)</em></strong><br>This is one cheeky, moving and <strong>relevant</strong> coming-of-age movie that every teenager should watch atleast once. I am personally indebted to this movie for introducing me to the ethereal Cocteau Twins.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Spider-Man Far from Home (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Yea, I enjoy Marvel when I lose my sense of purpose in life and love to squander my time at things less important than planning the next rebellion.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>If I Stay (2014) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>A mix of desperation and biological hormones induced me to pick up this piece of warm, cozy heart-breaker. &ldquo;Heart Like Yours&rdquo; by Williamette Stone is my takeaway from this endeavour.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Imitation Game (2014) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Let&rsquo;s face it, <em>every biographical movie is eschewed of facts to make the person under scrutiny to appear as a fabled warrior mainly for PR and marketing</em>. Applying this baseline judgement criterion, I don&rsquo;t find any biographical movie appealing thus <em>I prefer books</em>. But, yeah from a tender age, A. Turing has been my hero-ish person. 😃</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Star Wars The Last Jedi (2017) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Yes, a nerd here! But this one&rsquo;s not as appealing.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Boss Baby (2017) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Upon heavy insistence from my sister (A harsh truth: Every brother has to ultimately succumb to the whimps of his younger sister, no matter how <em>ridiculous</em> those demands are). An OK movie.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Legit nerd, this blogger of yours!</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Interstellar (2014) <em>(x2)</em></strong><br>A mind-bending masterpiece. Thoroughly researched (which I admired), fantastic storyline, gripping cinematography and amazing soundtracks. Typical Nolan goodness!</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Booksmart (2019) <em>(x1.5)</em></strong><br>It was a result of a desperate movie-hunting spree. But not disappointed as such.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Intern (2015) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Nice story and good performances by Robert de Niro and Anna Hathaway.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jumanji The Next Level (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Sister rant.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Ready Player One (2018) <em>(x2)</em></strong><br>Brimming full of references from the 80s, this is a retro kid&rsquo;s paradise. (The book is <em>even</em> better) Top-notch motion capture and typical Spielberg cinematogrpahy. I loved it!</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle (2017) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Sister rant.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Dunkirk (2017) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Another Nolan epic. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t enjoy subdued voices a lot.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Forrest Gump (1994) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>This is pure delight from the 90s. A fitting watch for a lazy Saturday afternoon.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Me Before You (2016) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Result of a movie-hunting spree. But a nice moving story. The book by Jojo Moyes is on my distant TBR!</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Disappointed. I couldn&rsquo;t get what really happened in the end apart from lots of colour splashes which would send a epileptic person into hysteria and horrification which was completely unnecessary.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Knives Out (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Oh, what a delightful modern day detective story this is! It managed to have my undivided attention for the entire movie duration and more. Also, my introduction to Daniel Craig.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jurassic Park (1993) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>A Classic. Enough said.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jurassic Park The Lost World (1997) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>The second is rarely as good as the first, but I have come to believe that&rsquo;s more a result of our own psychological judgement system than a deficiency on the part of the production.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jurassic Park 3 (2001) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>You kinda get the idea where this is going. :)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Se7en (1995) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Absolutely gruelsome and gut-wrenching. Kevin Spacey as John Doe is one of <em>the</em> most formiddable characters of all times. You should watch this once. Personally, this was the first time when my sister complemented me on a movie I choose which is a exceedingly rare occasion.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Home Alone (1990) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Classic, to some extent anyway. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin was badass and adorable. A sister rant.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jurassic World (2015) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>I thought this was on par with the first movie and maybe, I&rsquo;ll hazard to say, better.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Home Alone 2 Lost in New York (1992) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Ok. These are honestly recommended for primary school kids.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom (2018) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>This movie is basically preparatory ground for what is about to come which is Jurassic World: Dominion which will pick up from where things got interesting and also where things left off. (As of this writing, shooting for Dominion has just finished with extensive expenditure due to the pandemic, according to news)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>A quirky and extremely cool take on the idea of love and its meaning. I loved it from start to finish. Also, my introduction to Kate Winslet.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Dark Knight (2008) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>You gotta watch this crazy shit. Formidable work by Nolan.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Pulp Fiction (1994) <em>(x2)</em></strong><br>I was basically ROFL-ing here. A more helpful title would be &ldquo;An insight into the practical dilemmas of existence for the mafia and his aides&rdquo;. A must-watch for anytime.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Night At The Museum (2006) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Sister rant. Only good thing would be &ldquo;Tonight&rdquo; by Keke Palmer and my introduction to rap. (or whatever they call it)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Requiem for a Dream Director&rsquo;s Cut (2000) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>A brutal masterpiece which is as relevant today as ever. You can <a href=/requiem-for-a-dream-a-melancholic-masterpiece>read more</a> about what I have to say.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Social Network (2010) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>A look into how a Harvard wallflower went on to become the youngest billionaire in the world (and the controversies that ensued). However, facts obscured. Also, who the hell is Erica Albright?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Iron Man (2008) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Origin story for the fictitious legend who is a messiah for all the nerds in this world. Radiant as ever.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Shawshank Redemption (1994) <em>(x2)</em></strong><br>9.3 on IMDb. Enough said.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Fight Club (1999) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Do you know what is the most intimate desire of every man? <em>To be free.</em> Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is the flamboyant manifestation of that desire alive somewhere in every man&rsquo;s heart. And, the climax is, well, a different game altogether.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Silence of the Lambs (1991) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>I have seen psychological thrillers before but this is uncomfortable. There is an inherent undertone of fear at every moment of the movie. I most certainly believe it is all courtesy the terrifying Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Godfather (1972) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Exquisite stuff. I think this film is so highly revered for good reasons. Francis Coppola&rsquo;s <em>magnum opus</em>? I am too unqualified to comment on that.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse (2018) <em>(x1.5)</em></strong><br>A refreshing break from the insane monotonous routine imposed by this year. I was running the risk of becoming mad and this sorta saved me.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Blade Runner (1997) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>I liked it. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of those iconic things that stay after with one after a long time. The imagery, the techniques, everything is top-notch.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Blade Runner 2049 (2017) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Nothing is as good as the first, as I have often observed. So is it with Blade Runner but its still a commendable effort and I kinda enjoyed it.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Eyes Wide Shut (1999) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>What the f just happened?!</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Fifth Element (1997) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>I cannot decide if I liked or hated The Fifth Element. It&rsquo;s ridiculous in my opinion but funny at the same time. I really have no idea if I should be traumatised or if I should rejoice.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Tenet (2020) <em>(x1.75)</em></strong><br>Mind blown. Do I expect Nolan to disappoint?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Four Weddings and a Funeral (1997) <em>(x1.5)</em></strong><br>I asked my pals for a comedy as I feared I was getting depressed (which in a sense, I am still) and came out this hilarious suggestion. Perfect watch for a saturday afternoon though not with kids.</p></blockquote></li></ol><hr><h3 id=2021>2021</h3><ol><li><blockquote><p><strong>Jojo Rabbit (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong><br>Now as I am writing this, I wonder why have I watched this only once?(!) It&rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Terminator (1984) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>Loved it. And you do know how I absolutely crush on the 80s? Those were the times, ah.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Terminator 2 (1991) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Watched them both for the sheer cult status the Terminator series enjoy in the geek culture. Though, I may not watch the later ones. Besides, I believe Cameron sufficiently messes up the timeline by the end of T2. 🤷‍♂️</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The White Tiger (2021) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>This was inevitable. After watching the trailer on YouTube, I grabbed the book by A. Adiga and then to catch this adaptation starring a fitting Adarsh Grover as Balram Halwai. And partially to drag my sister into atleast relishing this satire (she hates books).</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Lion King (1994) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A nice cozy kid&rsquo;s movie with substantial life skill sermons. And yes, I watched it. For the first time. And I am not ashamed.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>10 Things I Hate About You (1999) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>I am so happy I watched this &ldquo;Taming of the Shrew&rdquo; adaptation. I liked it. Quite. Loved that football ground sabotage 🤣 and found the post-paintball confrontation cute. Overall an impressive teen movie.<br>(first watch: Feb 10, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Spectacular Now (2013) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>What a spectacular movie! Aimie Finicky is <em>the</em> girl to die for. Played fittingly by S. Woodley who brought out the beauty, brilliance and vulnerabilities of this strong lady who is so fabulous within. Sutter is <strong>definitely</strong> not me! PS: Gosh, their bed scene together. 💯<br>(first watch: Feb 14, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Something Ventured (2011) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A brilliant documentary about the &ldquo;first venture capitalists&rdquo;. Basically meticulous men who took advantage of the times to make truck loads of money. Intel, Genentech, Apple, Atari, Cisco etc. I liked it. Will revisit sure. Recommended.<br>(first watch: Feb 15, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Fountain (2004) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>What the f basically happened?! I respect Darren and I&rsquo;ll just say, this was <em>too</em> profound for me!<br>(first watch: Feb 17, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Helvetica (2007) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Recommended by David Kadavy in his book &ldquo;Design for Hackers&rdquo;. It is always fun to learn about something new. I liked it but will also be compelled to say, was kinda bored! :P<br>(first watch: Feb 18, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Black Swan (2010) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Yet another of Darren Aronofsky&rsquo;s works. It was much better than &ldquo;The Fountain&rdquo; (<em>rolling my eyes</em>!). It didn&rsquo;t disappoint. I wrote my interpretations <a href=/black-swan>here</a>.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Marriage Story (2019) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Surprisingly, a good watch. Deals with marriage failure, divorce and related ugly stuff. Don&rsquo;t watch if you&rsquo;re going through a &ldquo;happy&rdquo; phase in your relationship. I can <a href=/marriage-story>indulge</a> you if you wish.<br>(first watch: Feb 21, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>12 Monkeys (1995) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>One of those spontaneous moments when I watch something wholly unplanned. My defense is: IMDb rated it 8! Read <a href=/12-monkeys>more</a> about it.<br>(first watch: Feb 24, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Sixth Sense (1999) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Wow. And I mean that. Absolutely didn&rsquo;t see the end coming. The climax took this movie to a different level altogether. Fictitious but recommended.<br>(first watch: Feb 27, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Amelie (2001) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Just a random watch a day before my physics examination. It was in French so amazing that way too!<br>(first watch: Mar 03, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>My introduction to Martin Scorcese (I believe). It was interesting. (Very) relevatory and hilarious at the same time. Pretty memory of watching till 3 in the morning cause insomnia. Can&rsquo;t wait to rewatch. Oh, and not a kid movie.<br>(first watch: Mar 12, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Dictator (2012) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A friend suggestion. I was literally rofling. Dark comedy and stuff. Besides, that NYC shot at night left me hypnotized. That&rsquo;s where I wanna be.<br>(first watch: Mar 17, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Before Sunrise (1995) <em>(X3)</em></strong><br>A beautiful movie. I&rsquo;m glad I watched this. I wrote things I felt <a href=/before-sunrise>here</a>.<br>(first watch: Mar 28, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Before Sunset (2004) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>A >1 hour conversation between two adult humans never felt this wholesome. Read about it <a href=/before-sunset>here</a>.<br>(first watch: Mar 29, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Moneyball (2011) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Baseball and data analytics. Informative.<br>(first watch: Mar 31, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>The story of the legendary rock band Queen and the eccentric showman Freddie Mercury. The Live Aid concert was pretty closely reproduced (I ascertained after watching the footage on YT).<br>(first watch: Apr 1, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Tron (1982) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br><em>What if computer programs had a secret life of their own?</em> No doubt it is a timeless revolutionary thought. I liked it.<br>(first watch: Apr 7, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Tron: Legacy (2010) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>I don&rsquo;t think I liked the story that much but it was beautiful to look at and that&rsquo;s fair enough.<br>(first watch: Apr 9, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>A John Hughes' story that was referenced in RP2. It&rsquo;s very well-written and I liked it. Actually, more than that. I think I can revisit it.<br>(first watch: Apr 10, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Breakfast Club (1985) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <a href=/the-breakfast-club>more</a><br>Quite a profound movie. They say it&rsquo;s a classic and for good reasons. Of course, it may not &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; to a lot but I can revisit it.<br>(first watch: Apr 11, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Sixteen Candles (1984) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>This was a weird one to be honest. I did not like it inspite of the classic status etc. It&rsquo;s offensive in parts.<br>(first watch: Apr 12, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off (1986) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Another one of those weird ones. It was fine but for a running time of 120 minutes, it was a bit of a drag. Will not revisit this.<br>(first watch: Apr 13, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Mean Girls (2004) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Weird one. There is nothing here that will interest me to revisit it in the future. So nah, not my thing. However, murmurs of &ldquo;Halcyon On and On&rdquo; by Orbital lit me up in the outro.<br>(first watch: Apr 14, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Before Midnight (2013) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <a href=/before-midnight>more</a><br>This is exactly how I wanted it to end and I am satisfied.<br>(first watch: Apr 14, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Parasite (2019) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>It&rsquo;s a bloody masterpiece.<br>(first watch: Apr 19, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Gone Girl (2014) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>WTF? A twisted thriller.<br>(first watch: Apr 25, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>All the Bright Places (2020) <em>(X2.5)</em></strong> <a href=/all-the-bright-places>more</a><br>Felt lazy. Couldn&rsquo;t read the book. Cried at the end. Awesome soundtrack.
(first watch: Apr 26, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Chhichhore (2019) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>I was laughing hard. Probably the only thing I can relate to so badly.<br>(first watch: Apr 27, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Map of Tiny Perfect Things (2021) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Just to pass time. You have no idea how depressed I am right now all alone.<br>(first watch: Apr 30, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>One Flew Over The Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest (1975) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A very interesting watch. Recommended by a classmate.<br>(first watch: May 1, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Hackers (1995) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>One peculiar thing about ventures are that they tell us how not to do it.<br>(first watch: May 4th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for Alaska (2019) (Series)</strong><br>It&rsquo;s devastatingly painful. Not to mention, John&rsquo;s eloquent vblogs on yt.<br>(first watch: <em>does it make sense?</em> )</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>American Beauty (1999) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Interesting and creative.<br>(first watch: May 7th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Scam 1992 (2020) (Series)</strong><br>Informative and elegantly produced. My faith in Indian production has been restored considerably. I can revisit this anytime.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Graduate (1967) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A classic. Few artistic expressions can capture the popular imagination with such fervour that they can change the course of reality. This is one of those movies.<br>(first watch: May 10th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Memories of Murder (2003) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Another Boon Jong-Ho work. Kept the suspense intact till the very last. Recommended if you liked Parasite.<br>(first watch: May 11th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Pretty in Pink (1986) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <a href=/pretty-in-pink>more</a><br>Typical John Hughes. I liked it though.<br>(first watch: May 12th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>500 Days of Summer (2009) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A good story. But I absolutely hate to think what my destiny/fate holds.<br>(first watch: May 13th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Big Short (2015) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>A breakdown of the circumstances leading to the 2008 market crash. Essential financial awareness movie.<br>(first watch: May 23rd, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Dark Season 1 (2017) (Series)</strong><br>Science Fiction and Thriller. It explores paradoxes like Grandfather paradox, Bootstrap paradox among others. Cannot wait for S02 and S03.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Dark Season 2 (2019) (Series)</strong><br>Twisted and getting slightly overtly complicated. No new concepts were introduced, the main ideas from season 1 put in a different wrapper and mixed with tons of suspenseful music.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</strong><br>To be honest, lacked the thrill of the second movie in the trilogy, however, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Anna Hathaway as Selina Kyle was amazing but clearly, Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate was incredible.<br>(first watch: Insufficient Information)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Bruce Almighty (2003) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>Insomnia. I have no idea what I am doing. It&rsquo;s 2:45 in the AM. Weird movie. All family movies are weird.<br>(first watch: Jun 4th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Avengers: Endgame (2019) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>A satisfying finale. A literal trip down memory lane well executed. Hard to see why this won&rsquo;t turn any Avengers fan giddy. I liked it.<br>(first watch: Jun 9th, 2021)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Perfect Blue (1997) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <span class="badge danger">Favourite</span><br>Brilliant and fascinating.
