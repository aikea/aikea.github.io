<p>Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)</p>
<p>I am a <em>big</em> organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the <em>primary</em> motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning.</p>
<ol>

<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jojo Rabbit (2019) <em>(x1)</em></strong> <br>
Now as I am writing this, I wonder why have I watched this only once?(!) It&rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Terminator (1984) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
Loved it. And you do know how I absolutely crush on the 80s? Those were the times, ah.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Terminator 2 (1991) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Watched them both for the sheer cult status the Terminator series enjoy in the geek culture. Though, I may not watch the later ones. Besides, I believe Cameron sufficiently messes up the timeline by the end of T2. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The White Tiger (2021) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
This was inevitable. After watching the trailer on YouTube, I grabbed the book by A. Adiga and then to catch this adaptation starring a fitting Adarsh Grover as Balram Halwai. And partially to drag my sister into atleast relishing this satire (she hates books).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lion King (1994) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
A nice cozy kid&rsquo;s movie with substantial life skill sermons. And yes, I watched it. For the first time. And I am not ashamed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>10 Things I Hate About You (1999) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
I am so happy I watched this &ldquo;Taming of the Shrew&rdquo; adaptation. I liked it. Quite. Loved that football ground sabotage ü§£ and found the post-paintball confrontation cute. Overall an impressive teen movie.<br>
(first watch: Feb 10, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Spectacular Now (2013) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
What a spectacular movie! Aimie Finicky is <em>the</em> girl to die for. Played fittingly by S. Woodley who brought out the beauty, brilliance and vulnerabilities of this strong lady who is so fabulous within. Sutter is <strong>definitely</strong> not me! PS: Gosh, their bed scene together. üíØ<br>
(first watch: Feb 14, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Something Ventured (2011) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A brilliant documentary about the &ldquo;first venture capitalists&rdquo;. Basically meticulous men who took advantage of the times to make truck loads of money. Intel, Genentech, Apple, Atari, Cisco etc. I liked it. Will revisit sure. Recommended. <br>
(first watch: Feb 15, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Fountain (2004) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
What the f basically happened?! I respect Darren and I&rsquo;ll just say, this was <em>too</em> profound for me! <br>
(first watch: Feb 17, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helvetica (2007) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Recommended by David Kadavy in his book &ldquo;Design for Hackers&rdquo;. It is always fun to learn about something new. I liked it but will also be compelled to say, was kinda bored! :P<br>
(first watch: Feb 18, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Black Swan (2010) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
Yet another of Darren Aronofsky&rsquo;s works. It was much better than &ldquo;The Fountain&rdquo; (<em>rolling my eyes</em>!). It didn&rsquo;t disappoint. I wrote my interpretations <a href=/black-swan-2010>here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Marriage Story (2019) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Surprisingly, a good watch. Deals with marriage failure, divorce and related ugly stuff. Don&rsquo;t watch if you&rsquo;re going through a &ldquo;happy&rdquo; phase in your relationship. I can <a href=/marriage-story>indulge</a> you if you wish.<br>
(first watch: Feb 21, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>12 Monkeys (1995) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
One of those spontaneous moments when I watch something wholly unplanned. My defense is: IMDb rated it 8! Read <a href=/12-monkeys>more</a> about it. <br>
(first watch: Feb 24, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Sixth Sense (1999) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Wow. And I mean that. Absolutely didn&rsquo;t see the end coming. The climax took this movie to a different level altogether. Fictitious but recommended.<br>
(first watch: Feb 27, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amelie (2001) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Just a random watch a day before my physics examination. It was in French so amazing that way too!<br>
(first watch: Mar 03, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
My introduction to Martin Scorcese (I believe). It was interesting. (Very) relevatory and hilarious at the same time. Pretty memory of watching till 3 in the morning cause insomnia. Can&rsquo;t wait to rewatch. Oh, and not a kid movie. <br>
(first watch: Mar 12, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Dictator (2012) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A friend suggestion. I was literally rofling. Dark comedy and stuff. Besides, that NYC shot at night left me hypnotized. That&rsquo;s where I wanna be.<br>
(first watch: Mar 17, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Before Sunrise (1995) <em>(X3)</em></strong><br>
A beautiful movie. I&rsquo;m glad I watched this. I wrote things I felt <a href=/before-sunrise>here</a>. <br>
(first watch: Mar 28, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Before Sunset (2004) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
A >1 hour conversation between two adult humans never felt this wholesome. Read about it <a href=/before-sunset>here</a>. <br>
(first watch: Mar 29, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moneyball (2011) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Baseball and data analytics. Informative.<br>
(first watch: Mar 31, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
The story of the legendary rock band Queen and the eccentric showman Freddie Mercury. The Live Aid concert was pretty closely reproduced (I ascertained after watching the footage on YT).<br>
(first watch: Apr 1, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tron (1982) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
<em>What if computer programs had a secret life of their own?</em> No doubt it is a timeless revolutionary thought. I liked it. <br>
(first watch: Apr 7, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tron: Legacy (2010) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
I don&rsquo;t think I liked the story that much but it was beautiful to look at and that&rsquo;s fair enough.<br>
(first watch: Apr 9, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
A John Hughes' story that was referenced in RP2. It&rsquo;s very well-written and I liked it. Actually, more than that. I think I can revisit it.<br>
(first watch: Apr 10, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Breakfast Club (1985) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <a href=/the-breakfast-club>more</a> <br>
Quite a profound movie. They say it&rsquo;s a classic and for good reasons. Of course, it may not &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; to a lot but I can revisit it.<br>
(first watch: Apr 11, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sixteen Candles (1984) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
This was a weird one to be honest. I did not like it inspite of the classic status etc. It&rsquo;s offensive in parts. <br>
(first watch: Apr 12, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off (1986) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Another one of those weird ones. It was fine but for a running time of 120 minutes, it was a bit of a drag. Will not revisit this.<br>
(first watch: Apr 13, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mean Girls (2004) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Weird one. There is nothing here that will interest me to revisit it in the future. So nah, not my thing. However, murmurs of &ldquo;Halcyon On and On&rdquo; by Orbital lit me up in the outro.<br>
(first watch: Apr 14, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Before Midnight (2013) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <a href=/before-midnight>more</a><br>
This is exactly how I wanted it to end and I am satisfied. <br>
(first watch: Apr 14, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Parasite (2019) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <br>
It&rsquo;s a bloody masterpiece.<br>
(first watch: Apr 19, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gone Girl (2014) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
WTF? A twisted thriller.<br>
(first watch: Apr 25, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All the Bright Places (2020) <em>(X2.5)</em></strong> <a href=/all-the-bright-places>more</a><br>
Felt lazy. Couldn&rsquo;t read the book. Cried at the end. Awesome soundtrack.
(first watch: Apr 26, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chhichhore (2019) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
I was laughing hard. Probably the only thing I can relate to so badly.<br>
(first watch: Apr 27, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Map of Tiny Perfect Things (2021) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Just to pass time. You have no idea how depressed I am right now all alone. <br>
(first watch: Apr 30, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One Flew Over The Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest (1975) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A very interesting watch. Recommended by a classmate.<br>
(first watch: May 1, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hackers (1995) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
One peculiar thing about ventures are that they tell us how not to do it. <br>
(first watch: May 4th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Looking for Alaska (2019) (Series)</strong> <br>
It&rsquo;s devastatingly painful. Not to mention, John&rsquo;s eloquent vblogs on yt.<br>
(first watch: <em>does it make sense?</em> )</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>American Beauty (1999) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <br>
Interesting and creative. <br>
(first watch: May 7th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scam 1992 (2020) (Series)</strong><br>
Informative and elegantly produced. My faith in Indian production has been restored considerably. I can revisit this anytime.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Graduate (1967) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A classic. Few artistic expressions can capture the popular imagination with such fervour that they can change the course of reality. This is one of those movies.<br>
(first watch: May 10th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memories of Murder (2003) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Another Boon Jong-Ho work. Kept the suspense intact till the very last. Recommended if you liked Parasite.<br>
(first watch: May 11th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pretty in Pink (1986) <em>(X1)</em></strong> <a href=/pretty-in-pink>more</a><br>
Typical John Hughes. I liked it though. <br>
(first watch: May 12th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>500 Days of Summer (2009) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A good story. But I absolutely hate to think what my destiny/fate holds.<br>
(first watch: May 13th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Big Short (2015) <em>(X2)</em></strong><br>
A breakdown of the circumstances leading to the 2008 market crash. Essential financial awareness movie.<br>
(first watch: May 23rd, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dark Season 1 (2017) (Series)</strong><br>
Science Fiction and Thriller. It explores paradoxes like Grandfather paradox, Bootstrap paradox among others. Cannot wait for S02 and S03.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dark Season 2 (2019) (Series)</strong><br>
Twisted and getting slightly overtly complicated. No new concepts were introduced, the main ideas from season 1 put in a different wrapper and mixed with tons of suspenseful music.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</strong><br>
To be honest, lacked the thrill of the second movie in the trilogy, however, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Anna Hathaway as Selina Kyle was amazing but clearly, Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate was incredible.<br>
(first watch: Insufficient Information)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bruce Almighty (2003) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
Insomnia. I have no idea what I am doing. It&rsquo;s 2:45 in the AM. Weird movie. All family movies are weird.<br>
(first watch: Jun 4th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Avengers: Endgame (2019) <em>(X1)</em></strong><br>
A satisfying finale. A literal trip down memory lane well executed. Hard to see why this won&rsquo;t turn any Avengers fan giddy. I liked it.<br>
(first watch: Jun 9th, 2021)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Perfect Blue (1997) <em>(X2)</em></strong> <span class="badge success">
