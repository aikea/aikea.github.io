Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, &ldquo;undateable&rdquo; Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist&rsquo;s apartment in New York ❤️, &ldquo;All I have to show are my mistakes&rdquo;, and Frances&rsquo; expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.

Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.

All I can say is &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;. It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000</strong>
Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.

Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006</strong>
It&rsquo;s obvious that I&rsquo;m a fan of Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there&rsquo;s a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon:_The_Illusionist>2021 documentary</a> commemorating Kon&rsquo;s works. Yaaay!
PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa&rsquo;s OST is so addicting!

Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.

Watched with wingmates in hostel. Entertaining.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Sex Education | Season 02 | 2021</strong>
It is what it says on the tin but in a manner that is appealing to today&rsquo;s teenagers. It breaks the tradition, cliched (and cringed?) pedagogy of sex education and educates us subtly while concealing behind a teenage drama. Impressive and ingenious. Looking forward to season 3.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Won&rsquo;t you be my neighbor | Morgan Neville | 2018</strong>
<em>&ldquo;Always know that you&rsquo;re loved and are capable of loving&rdquo;</em>. I really needed to hear that right now. This is a documentary about Fred Rogers, a minister-to-be from Pittsburg, who by a turn of events got into television which was booming in the 60s. He wrote, produced, and directed <em>&ldquo;Mr. Rogers&rsquo; Neighborhood</em>&rdquo;, a TV program directed at young children. Mr. Rogers&rsquo; incredible understanding of child psychology coupled with his minsiterial training allowed him to present really sensitive issues like death, validation, and even divorce to young children. I really, really enjoyed getting to know this ambitious and noble man.
PS: This was on my list for a very long time.

I have taken to French cinema lately and it has been a rewarding experience so far. The movie at hand is an amalgamation of six different stories directed by six different directors, all capturing the spirit of the beautiful city of Paris. Stories of love, deceit, drama, humor, and even death. The plots are varied and wholesome. Worth rewatching just for the Parisian shots and the language. ❤️

A tale of unbridled passion on the part of an ultra-rich minister coerces him to lose everything he had. Frankly, the plot was too single dimensional and lacking dynamics. Watched it only for Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche ❤️.

I think I just needed some pre-majors cinematic recharge and this movie fitted the bill perfectly. No excessive mental overhead, no complex characters to analyse, or exceptional plots. The kind of romantic mushy love-found-lost-found teenage love story that makes you excessively giddy. Yeah, cute story.

LP is a coming-of-age love story set in the 80s. It chronicles the ups and downs in the relationship of a 25yr old girl with a 15yr old boy and follows both as they seek out their meaning and place in life, the boy involved in petty teenage activities while the girl matured and more pragmatic in her approach to life. Their huge age difference formed a major factor as to how they approached their relationship and most of the movie revolved how they &ldquo;worked it out&rdquo;. Relatively sparse, quirky events, and a tad bit long, I felt it was a movie designed to pass time.

Yet another Fincher classic. Suspenseful right from the first shot up until the end. Leaves the viewer pondering, with that lingering aftertaste of an incomplete, yet perfectly told story. Much to be learned from Fincher.

Fargo is an Oscar-winning &ldquo;comedy crime thriller&rdquo;. Directed by the brilliant Coen brothers, it&rsquo;s a fictional story of a inept car sales manager who pays a couple of henchmen to kidnap his wife in order to exhort money from his miser father-in-law. However, things go awry and end up pretty badly for everyone. Superb storytelling, that Minnesota accent, the stark white settings, and <em>Mike Yanagita</em> makes this a movie truly deserving of being included in many &ldquo;Best movies of all times&rdquo; lists. There are also subtle many subtle references to Alfred Htitchcock and Stanley Kubrick among others.

Holy cow! I want to kick myself for delaying this gem of a movie for <em>this</em> long. In this movie, Kon tells a romance story in his style, bringing together drama, love, poignance, piquing our interest, keeping us arrested in the disorienting whirlwind that is his <em>modus operandi</em>. There is chaos and yet, it doesn&rsquo;t feel chaotic. The blurry line between reality and imagination is a recurring theme in all of Kon&rsquo;s works and in this, it outshines. As Chiyoko remarks at the end, “After all, what I really love is the pursuit of him”, we are forced to rethink the basis of our affection.

A deeply metaphorical, introspective study of capitalism, exisiting societal structures, and the human nature. Has a quasi religious undertone to it. Intriguing and a good watch.

A beautiful film from start to finish. From the writing down to each individual shot, it exudes a sense of artistic appreciation in the executor. Paced and balanced story, had a tough time deciphering the Southern accent (lol), nice soundtrack, great dialogues. Overall, ~justified of being in Ebert&rsquo;s Best Movies list~ a good watch.

How do I even begin to describe this cherry of a movie? Imagine someone mixed video games, rock music, and a love story together. The plot, the execution, the brilliant cinematography, the creative editing (which I highly approve of), this movie speaks for something beyond its age. It&rsquo;s a weird movie, no doubt. But in a good way. And that is the best kind of weird, really.
So, the story follows this skinny Canadian boy called Scott Pilgrim who&rsquo;s reeling from past breakup and own problems when he meets Ramona Flowers, an American hipster and instantly falls in love with her. But he must defeat every member of the League of Evil Exes to get to be with her. It&rsquo;s the kind of boy-meet-girl, fall-in-love, can&rsquo;t-be-together, fight-against-all-odds, now-together, happy ending, reimagined.
And, the characters OMG! (And Mary Elizabeth&rsquo;s Ramona is so hot (LOL))
PS: There are seven of Ramona&rsquo;s exes.
PPS: Every teenager should watch this movie atleast once!
PPPS: And why only teenagers? (OK, I&rsquo;m too excited but it&rsquo;s a good movie, I can&rsquo;t help it. Ok, bye)

Set in LA, <em>Heat</em> is the classic police-and-theif chase story with a heart. Follows Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro) as he crafts master plans to rob banks, and execute dissidents, manage a personal life, etc. with Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a LAPD Homicide officer on his tail. It&rsquo;s a great movie on so many levels. Great writing, cinematography, acting. It managed to keep me at the edge of my seat till 3:30 AM (LOL). Great movie for a Saturday night with friends.

The story follows two teenager girls who are in love with each other but then one decides to act on the <em>&ldquo;log kya kahenge&rdquo;</em> narrative which leaves the other girl distraught. The movie essentially explores the intense disheaval and delirium that the lose of a lover can bring. I think the writing was disbalanced because the characters weren&rsquo;t realised to their full potential (For eg: the head mistress and her side-kick). I can imagine that it must have been &ldquo;blasphemous&rdquo; for a 2K1 audience for it does have few &ldquo;bold&rdquo; scenes. Also have to mention that Indian song/composition by Yves Chamberland which seems so out of place. Since it is unnamed, I couldn&rsquo;t find translation for the lyrics which is so sad. Yes, now I&rsquo;m gonna go and read Macbeth :P
PS: It doesn&rsquo;t end well.

This is <em>the</em> definition of action-packed. Amazing movie from all respects. Loved it. Can rewatch anytime. No breakthorughs in terms of technique or cinematography but exceptional usage of existing ones. Brilliant writing of course, and editing. Now I know what the hype is all about. Again, couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off it (!)
(first watch: July 2nd, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>American Psycho | Mary Harron | 2000</strong>
<em>American Psycho</em> is a open-ended, metaphorical study of the American capitalist mindset. It takes the idea of the quintessential Wall Street banker and stretches that to its extreme. It is beyond doubt that this movie counts among the finest of modern cult classics. The suspense, the drama, the sheer terror of it all, the constant pinging question of the fate of the next person Patrick Bateman would meet. Bateman stands in the company of the finest villains such as Anton Chigurh, John Doe, and Hannibal Lecter. His presence in the frame itself is terrifying and to achieve such effect requires a mastery of the craft. I admit that the ending is ambigous. We never know if it was Bateman&rsquo;s imagination or for real but I think that makes sense because in the high-class, ultra-rich American bourgeois circles, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. We see that detective Kimball was unable to link any of the murders back to Bateman and just to add to your annoyance, <em>none</em> of the &ldquo;murders&rdquo; committed by Patrick were seen by other people on screen. So, is Bateman the metaphorical representation of the American rich dog who is above law and order and can get away with any crime, no matter how heinous or is he the representation of the over-clocked American workman who has lost it under anxiety and tension?
I watched this with a friend and totally enjoyed it. Brilliant cinematography for eg: the casual shot of Bateman opening his refrigerator door to reveal a severed female head wrapped in plastic or the stored dead female bodies in his closet. It&rsquo;s how quickly Harron was able to escalate situations that makes this movie a super edgy watch.

A modern musical based on the A Capella style of music making. Enjoyed the witty dialogues and the deadpan, sometimes dark humour.
