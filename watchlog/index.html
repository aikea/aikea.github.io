Basil</div><h1 class=post-title>Watchlog</h1><div class=post-line></div><p>Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)</p><p>I am a <em>big</em> organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the <em>primary</em> motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning.</p><ol><li><a href=/wl/2020/>2020</a></li><li><a href=/wl/2021/>2021</a></li></ol><h3 id=2022>2022</h3><ol><li><blockquote><p><strong>Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012</strong><br>Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, &ldquo;undateable&rdquo; Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist&rsquo;s apartment in New York ❤️, &ldquo;All I have to show are my mistakes&rdquo;, and Frances&rsquo; expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.<br>(first watch: Jan 10th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014</strong><br>Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.<br>(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Her | Spike Jonze | 2013</strong><br>Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.<br>(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>*<strong>Friends | Season 10</strong><br>All I can say is &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;. It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000</strong><br>Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.<br>(first watch: Jan 21st, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Sex Education | Season 01 | 2021</strong><br>Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006</strong><br>It&rsquo;s obvious that I&rsquo;m a fan of Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there&rsquo;s a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon:_The_Illusionist>2021 documentary</a> commemorating Kon&rsquo;s works. Yaaay!<br>PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa&rsquo;s OST is so addicting!<br>(first watch: Jan 22nd 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Life in a Day | Ridley Scott and Kevin McDonald | 2010</strong><br>Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.<br>(first watch: Jan 23rd, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Special Ops | Season 1</strong><br>Watched with wingmates in hostel. Entertaining.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Sex Education | Season 02 | 2021</strong><br>It is what it says on the tin but in a manner that is appealing to today&rsquo;s teenagers. It breaks the tradition, cliched (and cringed?) pedagogy of sex education and educates us subtly while concealing behind a teenage drama. Impressive and ingenious. Looking forward to season 3.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Won&rsquo;t you be my neighbor | Morgan Neville | 2018</strong><br><em>&ldquo;Always know that you&rsquo;re loved and are capable of loving&rdquo;</em>. I really needed to hear that right now. This is a documentary about Fred Rogers, a minister-to-be from Pittsburg, who by a turn of events got into television which was booming in the 60s. He wrote, produced, and directed <em>&ldquo;Mr. Rogers&rsquo; Neighborhood</em>&rdquo;, a TV program directed at young children. Mr. Rogers&rsquo; incredible understanding of child psychology coupled with his minsiterial training allowed him to present really sensitive issues like death, validation, and even divorce to young children. I really, really enjoyed getting to know this ambitious and noble man.<br>PS: This was on my list for a very long time.<br>(first watch: Feb 1st, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Paris vu par (Six in Paris) | 1965</strong><br>I have taken to French cinema lately and it has been a rewarding experience so far. The movie at hand is an amalgamation of six different stories directed by six different directors, all capturing the spirit of the beautiful city of Paris. Stories of love, deceit, drama, humor, and even death. The plots are varied and wholesome. Worth rewatching just for the Parisian shots and the language. ❤️<br>(first watch: Feb 3rd, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Friends: The Reunion | 2021</strong><br>It was everything I expected it to be and more. It was hilarious to know these funny, little trivia and BTSs. And nostalgic, of course.<br>(first watch: Feb 5th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Damage | Louis Malle | 1992</strong><br>A tale of unbridled passion on the part of an ultra-rich minister coerces him to lose everything he had. Frankly, the plot was too single dimensional and lacking dynamics. Watched it only for Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche ❤️.<br>(first watch: Feb 10, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Sex Education | Season 03 | 2021</strong><br>Highly entertaining and thoughtful. Felt like a drag at places. But it ended on another cliffhanger :/</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Deep Throat | Gerard Damiano | 1972</strong><br>My eyes. My eyes! MY EYES!! What a terrible day to have eyes.<br>(first watch: Feb 16, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>The Worst Person in the World | Joachim Trier | 2021</strong><br>Stunning Norway! Each frame is so well-crafted. And then, the superb writing and the performances by Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen. Had a great time.<br>(first watch: Feb 18th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Endless Love | Shana Feste | 2014</strong><br>I think I just needed some pre-majors cinematic recharge and this movie fitted the bill perfectly. No excessive mental overhead, no complex characters to analyse, or exceptional plots. The kind of romantic mushy love-found-lost-found teenage love story that makes you excessively giddy. Yeah, cute story.<br>(first watch: Mar 3rd, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>A Walk to Remember | Adam Shankman | 2002</strong><br>Just timepass.<br>Okay. I <em>need</em> to diversify my list!<br>(first watch: Mar 5th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Licorice Pizza | Paul Thomas Anderson | 2021</strong><br>LP is a coming-of-age love story set in the 80s. It chronicles the ups and downs in the relationship of a 25yr old girl with a 15yr old boy and follows both as they seek out their meaning and place in life, the boy involved in petty teenage activities while the girl matured and more pragmatic in her approach to life. Their huge age difference formed a major factor as to how they approached their relationship and most of the movie revolved how they &ldquo;worked it out&rdquo;. Relatively sparse, quirky events, and a tad bit long, I felt it was a movie designed to pass time.<br>(first watch: Mar 12th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Spider Man: No Way Home | Jon Watts | 2021</strong><br>Great post-production. Storyline sets the backdrop for Multiverse of Madness. Digged the action sequences.<br>(first watch: Mar 28th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>In The Mood For Love | Wong Kar-Wai | 2000</strong><br>After I finished the movie, I had this intense want to re-watch the movie again. It&rsquo;s that good. Great story, brilliant cinematography, acting op, soundtrack. I think it all fits in quite well.<br>(first watch: Mar 30th, 2022)</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p><strong>Chungking Express | Wong Kar-Wai | 1994</strong><br>Someone rightfully said on an online review that &ldquo;You will like Chungking Express if you like films.&rdquo; Loved the cinematography especially those artsy shots. Also, the soundtrack is nice.<br>(first watch: Mar 31, 2021)</p></blockquote></li></ol><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts</h2><p>In any case, this is a curation of the movies I watched this year.</p><p>I would love to hear your thoughts, ideas or suggestions to add to this list!
