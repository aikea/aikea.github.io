<p>Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)</p>
<p>I am a <em>big</em> organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the <em>primary</em> motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012</strong><br>
Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, &ldquo;undateable&rdquo; Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist&rsquo;s apartment in New York ❤️, &ldquo;All I have to show are my mistakes&rdquo;, and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.<br>

<p><strong>Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014</strong><br>
Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.<br>
(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Her | Spike Jonze | 2013</strong><br>
Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.<br>
(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)</p>

<p>*<strong>Friends | Season 10</strong><br>
All I can say is &ldquo;Wow&rdquo;. It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000</strong><br>
Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.<br>
(first watch: Jan 21st, 2022)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sex Education | Season 01 | 2021</strong><br>
Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s obvious that I&rsquo;m a fan of Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there&rsquo;s a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon:_The_Illusionist>2021 documentary</a> commemorating Kon&rsquo;s works. Yaaay!<br>
PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa&rsquo;s OST is so addicting!<br>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Life in a Day | Ridley Scott and Kevin McDonald | 2010</strong><br>
Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.<br>
