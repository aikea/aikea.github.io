Not a groundbreaking movie but must have ripples back then. Mixed feelings.</description></item><item><title>Titanic</title><link>/watchlog/titanic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/titanic/</guid><description>Amazing film.

They say it&amp;rsquo;s a classic and for good reasons. Of course, it may not &amp;ldquo;appeal&amp;rdquo; to a lot but I can revisit it.</description></item><item><title>Some Kind Of Wonderful</title><link>/watchlog/some-kind-of-wonderful/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/some-kind-of-wonderful/</guid><description>A John Hughes' story that was referenced in RP2. It&amp;rsquo;s very well-written and I liked it. Actually, more than that. I think I can revisit it.</description></item><item><title>Tron:Legacy</title><link>/watchlog/tron-legacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/tron-legacy/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I liked the story that much but it was beautiful to look at and that&amp;rsquo;s fair enough.</description></item><item><title>Tron</title><link>/watchlog/tron/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/tron/</guid><description>What if computer programs had a secret life of their own? No doubt it is a timeless revolutionary thought. I liked it.</description></item><item><title>Bohemian Rhapsody</title><link>/watchlog/bohemian-rhapsody/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/bohemian-rhapsody/</guid><description>The story of the legendary rock band Queen and the eccentric showman Freddie Mercury. The Live Aid concert was pretty closely reproduced (I ascertained after watching the footage on YT).</description></item><item><title>Moneyball</title><link>/watchlog/moneyball/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/moneyball/</guid><description>Baseball and data analytics.

I&amp;rsquo;m glad I watched this. Expect more soon. Hopefully.</description></item><item><title>The Dictator</title><link>/watchlog/the-dictator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-dictator/</guid><description>A friend suggestion. I was literally rofling. Dark comedy and stuff. Besides, that NYC shot at night left me hypnotized. That&amp;rsquo;s where I wanna be.</description></item><item><title>The Wolf of Wall Street</title><link>/watchlog/the-wolf-of-wall-street/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-wolf-of-wall-street/</guid><description>My introduction to Martin Scorcese (I believe). It was interesting. (Very) relevatory and hilarious at the same time. Pretty memory of watching till 3 in the morning cause insomnia. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to rewatch. Oh, and not a kid movie.</description></item><item><title>Amelie</title><link>/watchlog/amelie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/amelie/</guid><description>Just a random watch a day before my physics examination. It was in French so amazing that way too!</description></item><item><title>The Sixth Sense</title><link>/watchlog/the-sixth-sense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-sixth-sense/</guid><description>Wow. And I mean that. Absolutely didn&amp;rsquo;t see the end coming. The climax took this movie to a different level altogether. Fictitious but recommended.</description></item><item><title>12 Monkeys</title><link>/watchlog/12-monkeys/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/12-monkeys/</guid><description>Wow.

Deals with marriage failure, divorce and related ugly stuff. Don&amp;rsquo;t watch if you&amp;rsquo;re going through a &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; phase in your relationship. I can [indulge][2] you if you wish.</description></item><item><title>Helvetica</title><link>/watchlog/helvetica/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/helvetica/</guid><description>Recommended by David Kadavy in his book &amp;ldquo;Design for Hackers&amp;rdquo;. It is always fun to learn about something new. I liked it but will also be compelled to say, was kinda bored! :P</description></item><item><title>The Fountain</title><link>/watchlog/the-fountain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-fountain/</guid><description>What the f basically happened?! I respect Darren and I&amp;rsquo;ll just say, this was too profound for me!</description></item><item><title>Something Ventured</title><link>/watchlog/something-ventured/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/something-ventured/</guid><description>A brilliant documentary about the &amp;ldquo;first venture capitalists&amp;rdquo;. Basically meticulous men who took advantage of the times to make truck loads of money. Intel, Genentech, Apple, Atari, Cisco etc. I liked it. Will revisit sure. Recommended.</description></item><item><title>The Spectacular Now</title><link>/watchlog/the-spectacular-now/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-spectacular-now/</guid><description>What a spectacular movie! Aimie Finicky is the girl to die for. Played fittingly by S. Woodley who brought out the beauty, brilliance and vulnerabilities of this strong lady who is so fabulous within. Sutter is definitely not me! PS: Gosh, their bed scene together. üíØ</description></item><item><title>10 Things I Hate About You</title><link>/watchlog/10-things-i-hate-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/10-things-i-hate-about-you/</guid><description>I am so happy I watched this &amp;ldquo;Taming of the Shrew&amp;rdquo; adaptation. I liked it. Quite. Loved that football ground sabotage ü§£ and found the post-paintball confrontation cute. Overall an impressive teen movie.</description></item><item><title>Black Swan</title><link>/watchlog/black-swan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/black-swan/</guid><description>Yet another of Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s works. It was much better than &amp;ldquo;The Fountain&amp;rdquo; (rolling my eyes!). It didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint. I wrote my interpretations [here][1].</description></item><item><title>Jojo Rabbit</title><link>/watchlog/jojo-rabbit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/jojo-rabbit/</guid><description>Now as I am writing this, I wonder why have I watched this only once?(!) It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.</description></item><item><title>Terminator</title><link>/watchlog/terminator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/terminator/</guid><description>Loved it. And you do know how I absolutely crush on the 80s? Those were the times, ah.</description></item><item><title>Terminator 2</title><link>/watchlog/terminator-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/terminator-2/</guid><description>Watched them both for the sheer cult status the Terminator series enjoy in the geek culture. Though, I may not watch the later ones. Besides, I believe Cameron sufficiently messes up the timeline by the end of T2. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</description></item><item><title>The Lion King</title><link>/watchlog/the-lion-king/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-lion-king/</guid><description>A nice cozy kid&amp;rsquo;s movie with substantial life skill sermons. And yes, I watched it. For the first time. And I am not ashamed.</description></item><item><title>The White Tiger</title><link>/watchlog/the-white-tiger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/the-white-tiger/</guid><description>This was inevitable. After watching the trailer on YouTube, I grabbed the book by A. Adiga and then to catch this adaptation starring a fitting Adarsh Grover as Balram Halwai. And partially to drag my sister into atleast relishing this satire (she hates books).</description></item><item><title>Watchlog</title><link>/watchlog/_watchlog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/watchlog/_watchlog/</guid><description>Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)
I am a big organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the primary motivations for this blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
