I can imagine the idea for this movie hitting like a full-formed idea as the director was listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel's Baby Driver. Good story, all features of a narrative feature. Vibrant soundtrack. Intriguing cinematography (I mean those robbery shots were enthralling). Lilly James is cute and Ansel Elgort. is adorable.
