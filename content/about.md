## What should you expect from this blog?   

{{<border>}}
This site is my journal. Expect rambling about my day-to-day business, my thoughts and interpretations of things and people around me.   

I will be as true and raw as a teenager can possibly be. I hope you'll take this as a sign of my maturity to acknowledge these issues rather than my sign of weakness.

<!-- 
How granular and detailed will my logs be? To be honest, I haven't figured it out but we will.     -->

## Who am I? :hamster:

Hi there! 

I am a boy. Teenager and all the baggage that comes with it.  
<!-- 
I am a boy. I am a non-conformist, open source enthusiast, avid reader, origamist, blogger and a natural philomath.    -->

In other news, I am a student too.  

## Maxims of my life

<!-- * I learn anything and everything I find interesting. I like challenges, academic or otherwise. 

* Insults and abuses don't offend me because they are transient. But ignorance and conceit does.   

* I am practical in my outlook to life, perhaps more so as I often get judged as a _nihilist_.  

* My questions are more "whys" than "whats/hows".   

* I believe in making an impact where it matters the most. In P. Theil's terminology, _"from zero to one"_.   

* I believe in letting knowledge be free for those who wish to acquire it.  

* I would rather be in a quiet place with few meaningful people than in a loud place with a crowd.  

* I am not a particularly fond sight to look at but I do good enough for a human being. I am _very_ insecure with strangers but can be _really great_ company if I can trust you.   

{{<background "primary">}}
* I idolize Aaron Swartz among many others. I quote Aaron saying 
{{<alert "danger">}}
"I don't hold grudges. They are unproductive".
{{</alert>}}
No one could possibly have put it more eloquently.

* I **can't stand** injustice and hypocrisy. -->
<!-- 
I **can't stand** injustice and hypocrisy. I feel quite strongly for institutions and systems that most of us have grown up with.     -->

<!-- 
* I am a perceptive person. I love to experiment with things (even if they are completely outside my domain) and make mistakes. -->

<!-- I like to look at a thing and ask questions which few others would ask.  -->

## Music :notes:   
<!-- 
I like to listen to stuff which doesn't stick to my head and accompany me to examination halls(!). I think "Cocteau Twins" are the perfect band for me with their shimmering soundscapes and Liz's ethereal, indecipherable voice. Send me to an island with all the CT tracks and I'll live happily ever after. 

Other interests include (but are not limited to) ABBA, Fleet Foxes, The Beatles and Beethoven.  -->

I like Led Zeppelin, U2, Adele among many others. Cocteau Twins deserve a mention too. 

I have an ear for classical too. The usual lot of Beethoven, Chopin and Mozart among others. 

## Reading :books:

I _love_ to read. I prefer non-fiction purely due to practical reasons but I appreciate good fiction too.   

## Other things I love :eyes: 

I am learning the guitar. I want to play the keyboard and I would love to drum.   

Paper folding and Electronics are few of my cherished hobbies. Talk reverse folds and 555 timers to me anytime :) 

## Contact me :mailbox_with_mail:

I hope you will enjoy your way around [here][0]!  :smile:
