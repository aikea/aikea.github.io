Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)   

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.

### 2022   

1. > **Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012**  
Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, "undateable" Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist's apartment in New York :heart:, "All I have to show are my mistakes", and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.
