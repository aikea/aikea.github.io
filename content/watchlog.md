Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)   

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.   

1. [2020][11]  
2. [2021][12]

### 2022   

1. > **Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012**  
Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, "undateable" Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist's apartment in New York :heart:, "All I have to show are my mistakes", and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.   
(first watch: Jan 10th, 2022)   

2. > **Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014**  
Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.  
(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)  

3. > **Her | Spike Jonze | 2013**   
Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn't disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.   
(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)    

4. > ***Friends | Season 10**   
All I can say is "Wow". It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.   

5. > **Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000**   
Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.  
(first watch: Jan 21st, 2022)     

6. > **Sex Education | Season 01 | 2021**   
Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.   

7. > **Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006**   
It's obvious that I'm a fan of Satoshi Kon's works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there's a [2021 documentary][13] commemorating Kon's works. Yaaay!   
PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa's OST is so addicting!   
(first watch: Jan 22nd 2022)    

8. > **Life in a Day | Ridley Scott and Kevin McDonald | 2010**  
Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.   
(first watch: Jan 23rd, 2022)  

9. > **Special Ops | Season 1**   
Watched with wingmates in hostel. Entertaining.   

10. > **Sex Education | Season 02 | 2021**   
It is what it says on the tin but in a manner that is appealing to today's teenagers. It breaks the tradition, cliched (and cringed?) pedagogy of sex education and educates us subtly while concealing behind a teenage drama. Impressive and ingenious. Looking forward to season 3.
