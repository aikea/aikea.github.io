Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.

### 2023

1. > **Tehran Taboo | Ali Soozandeh | 2017**   

Ali Soozandeh's is a hard-hiting, dark, social satire on the prevalent Islamist fundamentalist belief system and the double standards that encompass the lives of an average Muslim citizen trying to make sense of the modern world. It is engaging and especially gripping on a personal level as I have experienced some of these conundrums first-hand. Set in the city of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, it tells the microstories of people from different walks of life and how their life threads get intertwined as we progress through the film &ndash; all told in beautiful animation, the likes of which I have seen before in Robert Linklater's _Waking Life_. TT explores the themes of women rights, religion, prostitution, sexual desires, corruption, music, art, and more.   

It asks the question, "What is the identity of a Muslim citizen in the modern globalised world?" and brings forth the duality of a Muslim who has to deal with the constant internal battle of conforming to the teachings of his belief system and stepping out and matching steps with his contemporary Western counterpart.   

The film opens on a busy and bustling street of Tehran from the POV of a 50-something male driver. He lets a mother and son enter his car who asked for a lift. There's muffled conversation, there's money exchange and suddenly, the attractive female gets down to give the driver a BJ while he drives. The son at the back of the seat simply looks away, obviously not his first time witnessing his mother. The camera spans to a wide-field shot of the city of Tehran with the Tehran Tower visible in the distance and the words "Tehran Taboo" materializes. I was hooked.   

The woman in question is X, a strong-willed mother who starts whoring herself out to nurture her mute son. The son Elias is a wonderful addition to the cohort of different voices and perspectives offered in the film. He is innocent and uncorruptable. He cannot interfere and simply observes everything as people confide their darkest secrets in him. Elias represents the average non-Tehrani spectator, a foriegn spectator to the inner workings of the city of Tehran and its inhabitants. She is given residence by Judge Adel &ndash; the tower of hypocrisy who talks of "violation of religious values" on TV and keeps X for his personal needs outside of marriage.        

There are direct references to the oppressive, orthodox government, one which is known to derive its value from the most popular religion in the country. It is this intermingling of politics with religion which creates a sense of vaccum for the modern citizen. A couple who held hands in public were confronted by the police and the young man arrested. There are ample images of usage of _purdah_ in public places, the so-called grey _burqah_; especially among the older generation women. Iran remains, inspite of all, hostile to women and their values with an artificial but prominent barrier to women in terms of employment at judicial and administrative systems of the country. It is disheartening and sad but I'm optimistic about the women of Iran who are gradually awakening to their rights and beginning to question the patriarchial machinery that has been taken for granted. As highlighted by the recent Mahsa Amini protests that took the world by storm.   

There's the story of the young, budding musician who wants to make it big. He cannot get an album out because it doesn't conform to religious values of the country. There's Y, a poor young girl who ends up with the musician kid going around town trying to "restore her virginity" because her "husband" won't accept a non-virgin. Later, she reveals that she is the subject of human trafficking. _"Arabs pay fortunes for Iranian virgins."_ I felt sick. The boy fled too, leaving his dream behind a door from where the rockstar poster was torn off. And then there's Sara &ndash; a wife and a would-be mother who is unfortunately married into a conservative household where women don't work. She simply wants to be "useful" and don't want to get tied down to the usual duties of motherhood.      

Through all these stories, there's the recurrent image of Tehran Burger &ndash; a satirical, capitalist symbol that stands for everything that has penetrated the conservative Islamist culture of Tehran and forced the city to accept it anyways.      

TT is a fascinating tale of a group of people in Tehran who have come to cross each other's lives and now become a part of it, an intertwined mess where people know secrets about each other while others live in constant fear and anxiety of anticipating they don't. TT takes the delipidated and deteriorating culture of the Muslims and throws it at our faces. It's rebellious, it's beautiful, it's everything an angsty teenager seeing wrong in the world and who speaks up, stands for.

19. Masaan - Neeraj Ghaywan  

20. Notting Hill - Roger Mitchell (Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts)   

21. Buffalo '66 - Vincent Gallo

There is a certain beauty in Vincent Gallo's films. Those long quite shots of just focusing on a man not talking and for the most parts alone on screen. Amazing how he captures the plights of the lonely man.

Vincent's harsh portrayal of problematic, neurotic, misogynistic men is chilling and terrifying and utterly discomforting. And yet somewhere deep down, every single man would connect with what Vincent is showing us on screen. Yes, a superficial viewing of Vincent's works won't make you appreciate what he's doing but a deeper more thoughtful revisit will make you realise that it is not his protagonists that are the problem but the world around him, the people that surrounds him, and the environment he is brought up in. Take both films, The Brown Bunny (which deals with a man whose wife was raped and choked to death and who is dealing with the aftermath alone) and Buffalo '66 (where the protagonist had troublesome parents and a horrible childhood).

Characterisitcs: Overly sexualised women. Women presented as objects for satiation of the male fantasy. Also, Vincent doesn't shy away from using bold, unconventional editing and cinematography. For example, the climax dream sequence in Buffalo '66 where he imagines killing Scott Wood is amazingly executed.

22. The Royal Tenenbaums - Wes Anderson   

I love the characterisation told via mise-en-scene and voiceover narration. Very classic Wes Anderson. Like a visual fairytale. The story is about a strange and quirky family where each individual finds a reconcilation of their quirks and its a happy ending (well, not for Buckley but ok).   

23. A History of Violence - 2005

28. Hopscotch - Ronald Neame (1980)   

29. On The Road - Walter Salles (2012)   

30. The Lodger - Alfred Hitchcock

a. Suspense. We know that the lodger is coming back and yet the landlady is unaware of the fact and calmly examining his room. Heightens suspense. But it only works after establishing the lodger as a potential suspect (maybe red herring we don't know) and this is achieved by brilliant use of sound design, and human facial expressions and actions.

b. showing action A by showing the effect of action A. Involves the audience in making that leap of deduction. Conditioning once is required.

c. Very minimal camera movements. Primarily restricted to panning. 

d. Match cuts. Especially when the police were looking at the map drawing a region of suspect versus when the lodger was planning out this area of next crime.

e. The shot where the lodger is descending from the stairs and the top shot only shows the hand sliding on the railing as he goes down, through the gap between staircases.

f. The bottom shot of the man walking on glass to show that he is walking above. 

31. Full Metal Jacket - Stanley Kubrick 

Holy shit. Cinema to move the soul.

"Born to kill" and the peace symbol. "I think it has something to do with the duality of man, sir."

"Private Pyle"

The last shot by Joker.

The camera hovering through a fight scene.

"The first TV war" - Kubrick taking his jab at the ridiculous origins of the whole war
