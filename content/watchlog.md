Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.

1. [2020][11]
2. [2021][12]

### 2022

1. > **Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012**

Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, "undateable" Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist's apartment in New York :heart:, "All I have to show are my mistakes", and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.
(first watch: Jan 10th, 2022)

2. > **Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014**

Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.
(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)

3. > **Her | Spike Jonze | 2013**

Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn't disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.
(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)

4. > **Friends | Season 10**

All I can say is "Wow". It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.

5. > **Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000**

Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.
(first watch: Jan 21st, 2022)

6. > **Sex Education | Season 01 | 2021**

Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.

7. > **Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006**

It's obvious that I'm a fan of Satoshi Kon's works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there's a [2021 documentary][13] commemorating Kon's works. Yaaay!
PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa's OST is so addicting!
(first watch: Jan 22nd 2022)

8. > **Life in a Day | Ridley Scott and Kevin McDonald | 2010**

Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.
(first watch: Jan 23rd, 2022)

9. > **Special Ops | Season 1**

Watched with wingmates in hostel. Entertaining.

10. > **Sex Education | Season 02 | 2021**

It is what it says on the tin but in a manner that is appealing to today's teenagers. It breaks the tradition, cliched (and cringed?) pedagogy of sex education and educates us subtly while concealing behind a teenage drama. Impressive and ingenious. Looking forward to season 3.

11. > **Won't you be my neighbor | Morgan Neville | 2018**

_"Always know that you're loved and are capable of loving"_. I really needed to hear that right now. This is a documentary about Fred Rogers, a minister-to-be from Pittsburg, who by a turn of events got into television which was booming in the 60s. He wrote, produced, and directed _"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood_", a TV program directed at young children. Mr. Rogers' incredible understanding of child psychology coupled with his minsiterial training allowed him to present really sensitive issues like death, validation, and even divorce to young children. I really, really enjoyed getting to know this ambitious and noble man.
PS: This was on my list for a very long time.
(first watch: Feb 1st, 2022)

12. > **Paris vu par (Six in Paris) | 1965**

I have taken to French cinema lately and it has been a rewarding experience so far. The movie at hand is an amalgamation of six different stories directed by six different directors, all capturing the spirit of the beautiful city of Paris. Stories of love, deceit, drama, humor, and even death. The plots are varied and wholesome. Worth rewatching just for the Parisian shots and the language. :heart:
(first watch: Feb 3rd, 2022)

13. > **Friends: The Reunion | 2021**

It was everything I expected it to be and more. It was hilarious to know these funny, little trivia and BTSs. And nostalgic, of course.
(first watch: Feb 5th, 2022)

14. > **Damage | Louis Malle | 1992**

A tale of unbridled passion on the part of an ultra-rich minister coerces him to lose everything he had. Frankly, the plot was too single dimensional and lacking dynamics. Watched it only for Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche :heart:.
(first watch: Feb 10, 2022)

15. > **Sex Education | Season 03 | 2021**

Highly entertaining and thoughtful. Felt like a drag at places. But it ended on another cliffhanger :/

16. > **Deep Throat | Gerard Damiano | 1972**

My eyes. My eyes! MY EYES!! What a terrible day to have eyes.
(first watch: Feb 16, 2022)

17. > **The Worst Person in the World | Joachim Trier | 2021**

Stunning Norway! Each frame is so well-crafted. And then, the superb writing and the performances by Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen. Had a great time.
(first watch: Feb 18th, 2022)

18. > **Endless Love | Shana Feste | 2014**

I think I just needed some pre-majors cinematic recharge and this movie fitted the bill perfectly. No excessive mental overhead, no complex characters to analyse, or exceptional plots. The kind of romantic mushy love-found-lost-found teenage love story that makes you excessively giddy. Yeah, cute story.
(first watch: Mar 3rd, 2022)

19. > **A Walk to Remember | Adam Shankman | 2002**

Just timepass.
Okay. I _need_ to diversify my list!
(first watch: Mar 5th, 2022)

20. > **Licorice Pizza | Paul Thomas Anderson | 2021**

LP is a coming-of-age love story set in the 80s. It chronicles the ups and downs in the relationship of a 25yr old girl with a 15yr old boy and follows both as they seek out their meaning and place in life, the boy involved in petty teenage activities while the girl matured and more pragmatic in her approach to life. Their huge age difference formed a major factor as to how they approached their relationship and most of the movie revolved how they "worked it out". Relatively sparse, quirky events, and a tad bit long, I felt it was a movie designed to pass time.
(first watch: Mar 12th, 2022)

21. > **Spider Man: No Way Home | Jon Watts | 2021**

Great post-production. Storyline sets the backdrop for Multiverse of Madness. Digged the action sequences.
(first watch: Mar 28th, 2022)

22. > **In The Mood For Love | Wong Kar-Wai | 2000**

After I finished the movie, I had this intense want to re-watch the movie again. It's that good. Great story, brilliant cinematography, acting op, soundtrack. I think it all fits in quite well.
(first watch: Mar 30th, 2022)

23. > **Chungking Express | Wong Kar-Wai | 1994**

Someone rightfully said on an online review that "You will like Chungking Express if you like films." Loved the cinematography especially those artsy shots. Also, the soundtrack is nice.
(first watch: Mar 31, 2021)

24. > **Sen Yasamaya Bak (In Good Hands) | Ketche | 2022**

I guess this was my first exploration of Turkish cinema. Okay.
(first watch: Apr 2nd, 2022)

25. > **Zodiac | David Fincher | 2007**

Yet another Fincher classic. Suspenseful right from the first shot up until the end. Leaves the viewer pondering, with that lingering aftertaste of an incomplete, yet perfectly told story. Much to be learned from Fincher.
(first watch: Apr 14th, 2022)

26. > **Fargo | Coen Brothers | 1996**

Fargo is an Oscar-winning "comedy crime thriller". Directed by the brilliant Coen brothers, it's a fictional story of a inept car sales manager who pays a couple of henchmen to kidnap his wife in order to exhort money from his miser father-in-law. However, things go awry and end up pretty badly for everyone. Superb storytelling, that Minnesota accent, the stark white settings, and _Mike Yanagita_ makes this a movie truly deserving of being included in many "Best movies of all times" lists. There are also subtle many subtle references to Alfred Htitchcock and Stanley Kubrick among others.
(first watch: Apr 30th, 2022)

27. > **Lady Bird | Greta Gerwig | 2017**

Funny, balanced, mature. The story of this typical teenager girl from Sacramento who pushes through a financially unsound household, relationship, college, and just existence in general. Enjoyed it.
(first watch: May 2nd, 2022)

28. > **Skyfall | Sam Mendes | 2012**

Typical James Bond movie. Post-minor fallout.
(first watch: May 13, 2022)

29. > **Everything Everywhere All At Once | Kwan and Scheinert | 2022**

Nice concept but I think badly executed. Sick editing and mind-boggling cinematography.
(first watch: May 19th, 2022)

30. > **Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone | Chris Columbus | 2001**

Yes, this is the first time I watched this (stop with the shocked looks already, okay!). I was really meant to read first but time scarcity. Hence.
I really enjoyed the Diagon Alley vibes. Been going through some shit myself and needed somewhere to escape. This perfectly fitted the bill. And then, Emma Watson :purple_heart:
(first watch: May 20th, 2022)

31. > **One Day | Lone Scherfig | 2011**

Had to force myself to stop so I could finish the book first. But worth every bit of it. Anna Hathaway in one of her fine performances. And loved that cockney accent.
(first watch: Jun 02, 2022)

32. > **Breathless | Jean-Luc Godard | 1960**

Hm, what's such a big deal? Oh. Wait. Wow, WTF, this is genius!
(first watch: Jun 07, 2022)

33. > **Millennium Actress | Satoshi Kon | 2001**

Holy cow! I want to kick myself for delaying this gem of a movie for _this_ long. In this movie, Kon tells a romance story in his style, bringing together drama, love, poignance, piquing our interest, keeping us arrested in the disorienting whirlwind that is his _modus operandi_. There is chaos and yet, it doesn't feel chaotic. The blurry line between reality and imagination is a recurring theme in all of Kon's works and in this, it outshines. As Chiyoko remarks at the end, “After all, what I really love is the pursuit of him”, we are forced to rethink the basis of our affection. (first watch: Jun 12, 2022)

34. > **The Platform | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | 2019**

A deeply metaphorical, introspective study of capitalism, exisiting societal structures, and the human nature. Has a quasi religious undertone to it. Intriguing and a good watch.
(first watch: Jun 20, 20222)

35. > **Badlands | Terence Mallick | 1973**

A beautiful film from start to finish. From the writing down to each individual shot, it exudes a sense of artistic appreciation in the executor. Paced and balanced story, had a tough time deciphering the Southern accent (lol), nice soundtrack, great dialogues. Overall, ~justified of being in Ebert's Best Movies list~ a good watch.
(first watch: Jun 23, 2022)

36. > **Scott Pilgrim vs the World | Edgar Wright | 2010**

How do I even begin to describe this cherry of a movie? Imagine someone mixed video games, rock music, and a love story together. The plot, the execution, the brilliant cinematography, the creative editing (which I highly approve of), this movie speaks for something beyond its age. It's a weird movie, no doubt. But in a good way. And that is the best kind of weird, really.
So, the story follows this skinny Canadian boy called Scott Pilgrim who's reeling from past breakup and own problems when he meets Ramona Flowers, an American hipster and instantly falls in love with her. But he must defeat every member of the League of Evil Exes to get to be with her. It's the kind of boy-meet-girl, fall-in-love, can't-be-together, fight-against-all-odds, now-together, happy ending, reimagined.
And, the characters OMG! (And Mary Elizabeth's Ramona is so hot (LOL))
PS: There are seven of Ramona's exes.
PPS: Every teenager should watch this movie atleast once!
PPPS: And why only teenagers? (OK, I'm too excited but it's a good movie, I can't help it. Ok, bye)
(first watch: Jun 26, 2022)

37. > **Heat | Micheal Mann | 1995**

Set in LA, _Heat_ is the classic police-and-theif chase story with a heart. Follows Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro) as he crafts master plans to rob banks, and execute dissidents, manage a personal life, etc. with Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a LAPD Homicide officer on his tail. It's a great movie on so many levels. Great writing, cinematography, acting. It managed to keep me at the edge of my seat till 3:30 AM (LOL). Great movie for a Saturday night with friends.
(first watch: Jun 27, 2022)

38. > **Lost and Delirious | Leo Pool | 2001**

The story follows two teenager girls who are in love with each other but then one decides to act on the _"log kya kahenge"_ narrative which leaves the other girl distraught. The movie essentially explores the intense disheaval and delirium that the lose of a lover can bring. I think the writing was disbalanced because the characters weren't realised to their full potential (For eg: the head mistress and her side-kick). I can imagine that it must have been "blasphemous" for a 2K1 audience for it does have few "bold" scenes. Also have to mention that Indian song/composition by Yves Chamberland which seems so out of place. Since it is unnamed, I couldn't find translation for the lyrics which is so sad. Yes, now I'm gonna go and read Macbeth :P
PS: It doesn't end well.
PPS: Yes, this is me celebrating pride month at the end because exams :cry:
(first watch: Jun 30, 2022)

39. > **Mad Max: Fury Road | George Miller | 2015**

This is _the_ definition of action-packed. Amazing movie from all respects. Loved it. Can rewatch anytime. No breakthorughs in terms of technique or cinematography but exceptional usage of existing ones. Brilliant writing of course, and editing. Now I know what the hype is all about. Again, couldn't take my eyes off it (!)
(first watch: July 2nd, 2022)

40. > **American Psycho | Mary Harron | 2000**

_American Psycho_ is a open-ended, metaphorical study of the American capitalist mindset. It takes the idea of the quintessential Wall Street banker and stretches that to its extreme. It is beyond doubt that this movie counts among the finest of modern cult classics. The suspense, the drama, the sheer terror of it all, the constant pinging question of the fate of the next person Patrick Bateman would meet. Bateman stands in the company of the finest villains such as Anton Chigurh, John Doe, and Hannibal Lecter. His presence in the frame itself is terrifying and to achieve such effect requires a mastery of the craft. I admit that the ending is ambigous. We never know if it was Bateman's imagination or for real but I think that makes sense because in the high-class, ultra-rich American bourgeois circles, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. We see that detective Kimball was unable to link any of the murders back to Bateman and just to add to your annoyance, _none_ of the "murders" committed by Patrick were seen by other people on screen. So, is Bateman the metaphorical representation of the American rich dog who is above law and order and can get away with any crime, no matter how heinous or is he the representation of the over-clocked American workman who has lost it under anxiety and tension?
I watched this with a friend and totally enjoyed it. Brilliant cinematography for eg: the casual shot of Bateman opening his refrigerator door to reveal a severed female head wrapped in plastic or the stored dead female bodies in his closet. It's how quickly Harron was able to escalate situations that makes this movie a super edgy watch.
(first watch: July 2nd 2022)

41. > **Pitch Perfect | Jason Moore | 2012**

A modern musical based on the A Capella style of music making. Enjoyed the witty dialogues and the deadpan, sometimes dark humour. Character arcs were explicit and it was fun to revisit contemporary songs in an A capella setting. Watched it with a friend and learnt a lot of A capella-terms. A-ca-awesome (!)
(first watch: Jul 4th, 2022)

42. > **When Harry Met Sally | Rob Reiner | 1989**

Well, another classic off my list I suppose :p But it's a hilarious and touching movie. Laughed so hard at the fake Sally orgasm in the deli scene.

(first watch: Jul 5th, 2022)

43. > **Little Women | Greta Gerwig | 2019**

Wow, so many memorable lines. I really should have read the book :P They mean well when they say read the classics. One would actually want to live with the March sisters as they go about their business. Each sister is so well developed as a character and Alcott diversifed so well that every teenage girl, irrespective of their era, would be able to identify themselves with one of them. Love the conflict in Jo March's character. "I want to be great, or nothing" is so well-spoken. And then you have, "Writing doesn't confer importance, it reflects it". Cherry of a movie. Definitely watchable with kids around.

(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)

44. > **Blue is the Warmest Color | Abdellatif Kechiche | 2013**

Ok. I can understand now what the protests were all about when this came out 9 years ago. The male director _does_ seem to border on fetishizing lesbians. Other than that, I think it's a great movie nevertheless, although a tad too long.

(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)

45. > **District 9 | Neill Blomkamp | 2009**

Entertaining. Contains strong graphic violence. Liked the character arc.

(first watch: Jul 17th, 2022)

46. > **But I'm the Cheerleader | Jamie Babbit | 1999**

What's this movie LMFAO? It's so weird and cringey and unfinished. So, basically, a group of homosexuals are sent to a therapy school called 'True Directions' which is headed by a hot-headed (read: humorous) headmistress Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) who believes in the simple "five step" solution to "cure" homosexuality as if it's a disease. Very cringey writing, humorous and memorable characters. Overall, a funny movie.

(first watch: Jul 18th, 2022)

47. > **Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness | Sam Raimi | 2022**

I expect MCU to deliver monotonuous, cookie-cutter, feel-good movies and it never disappoints. Great for when I want to "switch off" my brain. Also, WTF Wanda?

(first watch: Jul 19th, 2022)

48. > **Phantom Thread | Paul Thomas Anderson | 2017**

Reynolds Woodcock is a successful fashion designer who is also a pain in the ass. A man who lost his mother at a young age and misses dearly, he is the antithesis of what he projects on the outside, when he's alone. The plot follows him and Alma Elson, an indomitable local waitress as they fall in love despite their differences and is beautifully told. There are some innovative camera shots in this movie.

(first watch: Jul 20th, 2022)

49. > **Arrival | Denis Villeneuve | 2016**

_Arrival_ is Ted Chiang's novella "Story of your life" adapted for the screen. Told in a non-linear chronological order by a Dr. Louise Banks, an accomplished linguist as she recalls events of the past and yet something of her manner of talking is disconcerting. She talks in "You'd" and "I'll" as if she's _already_ aware of what will happen. And indeed, the movie explores the themes of determinism, free-will, and eventually Cassandra complex in the behaviour of its protagonist, Louise. There is ample food for thought to the budding linguists in the language and its consequent decipherment of the "Heptapods" - the creatures who arrived. Amazing perfomances by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner (playing Dr. Ian Donnelly) alongwith brilliant direction from Villeneuve who is known for masterfully directing thrillers. Coherent and wholesome.

(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)

50. > **Inglorious Basterds | Quentin Tarantino | 2009**

By style and execution, this is a Tarantino all the way down (The skillfully directed strudel scene with Landa and Shoshanna in a confrontational ballet (contrary to the popular opinion of the opening chapter which is still great nevertheless)). Divided into chapters, it tells the fictional story of a group of Jewish-American-Italian rebel group that goes about terrorizing the Nazis of occupied France and the chase by Herr Hans Landa, an SS officer and the main antagonist of the movie. _Basterds_ lacked the chaotic harmony of _Pulp fiction_ where Tarantino masterfully weaved multiple plots and storyline into a cohesive whole. In that respect, _Basterds_ is a less ambitious ordeal. But let that not fool you from the exceptional cinematography and brilliant shots and compositions that once again proves Tarantino as a master of his art (Cue in the shot of a hesitant Shoshanna resting against a huge window). The characters of Landa and Adolf Hilter himself, written in their incredulously humorous and dumb-witted fashion, were reminiscient of Taika Waititi's another great movie, _Jojo Rabbit_. Great anti-war story with humour but I presume that is only to counter the explicit gore and violence that is one of Tarantino's regular motifs.

(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)

51. > **Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaara | Zoya Akhtar | 2011**

This. Movie. Is. A. Vibe. Amazingly writing, beautifully directed. Loved the poetry, the drama, the locales. One of those few pieces of art that makes you want to leave everything behind, pack your bags, and just head out. Kerouac's _On the Road_ made me feel this way too. Definitely rewatchable!

(first watch: Jul 23rd, 2022)

52. > **Rashomon | Akira Kurosawa | 1950**

My introduction to Kurosawa. _Rashomon_ is quite an accessible piece among his works. Loved it for the vivid emotions and the residual influence of silent films. That iconic "woodcutter walking into the forest" scene is visual pleasure for the cinephile. And I suppose there is enough said and analysed about the meaning of the plot, the puzzle of the "true" murderer, and the nature of objective truth and human psychology itself. In ~88 minutes, Akira Kurosawa takes us into a world bordering on the mystic and supernatural and shows us the power of ingenious cinematography, camera movements, and clever editing.
PS: A more critical piece is in the pipeline.

(first watch: Jul 27th, 2022)

53. > **Playtime | Jacques Tati | 1967**

Read more about this widely acclaimed French movie [here][14].

(first watch: Jul 30th, 2022)

54. > **La nuit americaine (Day for Night) | Francois Truffaut | 1973**

_Day for Night_ opens to what sounds like a conductor orchestrating an arrangement.  Cuts to a livid and bustling Parisian avenue in the daylight as the camera follows a man who follows and slaps another man._"CUT!"_ and we snap back to reality &ndash; a scene was shot. _Day for Night_, which borrows its name from a filmmaking technique that is used to shoot night scenes in daytime, is a film about films by the acclaimed French New Wave director, Francois Truffaut.

The rich French culture of appreciation of films as work of art shines through in this visual storytelling that verges on the metaphysical portraiture of making films itself. We follow director Ferrand (Francois Truffuat) as he fends a number of personal and professional problems of himself, the cast, and the crew to shoot a film called _"Meet Pamela"_ &ndash; an adulterous tale in which the hero's fiancee falls in love with his father.

In a voiceover he rhetorically asks: **"What is a director? Someone who's asked endless questions about everything."** and goes on to prove the validity of his answer. The film beautifully captures the multitude of things going wrong, taking unexpected turns, the improvisations, the cast whims, the cast breakdowns, crew management, the logistics, the producer, the studio, and what not. I strongly believe any budding filmmaker should watch this film atleast once.

What I appreciated was the fact that inspite of all hurdles, Truffaut manages to sneak in the fantasized, dream-like quality of cinema. Be it the bundle of book on filmmaking he got in order or montages of shooting set in beautiful composition accompanied by majestic upbeat music by composer Georges Delerue. He takes pride in his art like an artist in his painting. Ferrand's a restless detective, drawing inspiration from even the mundanities of existence. During the shoot, he improvises words spoken by the lead actress during her personal breakdown and introduced them as dialogues for her character! Or when he steals a blue vase from the hotel because it would fit perfectly in the scene. To be honest, it is difficult to point out where Ferrand ends and where Truffaut begins. A bit mischeivous, a bit crazy.

Filmmaking is a difficult job and perhaps, the job of the director the hardest.

> "A director must be a policeman, a midwife, a psychoanalyst, a sycophant, and a bastard."

~Billy Wender.

This movie is a great starting point to begin to understand that.

PS: [_The 400 Blows_][15] next :P
