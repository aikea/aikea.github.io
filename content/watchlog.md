Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)   

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.   

1. [2020][11]  
2. [2021][12]

### 2022   

1. > **Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012**  
Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, "undateable" Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist's apartment in New York :heart:, "All I have to show are my mistakes", and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.   
(first watch: Jan 10th, 2022)   

2. > **Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014**  
Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.  
(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)  

3. > **Her | Spike Jonze | 2013**   
Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn't disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.   
(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)    

4. > ***Friends | Season 10**   
All I can say is "Wow". It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.   

5. > **Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000**   
Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.  
(first watch: Jan 21st, 2021)
