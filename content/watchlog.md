Ok, I admit my defeat! Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)

I am a _big_ organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the _primary_ motivations for this blog.) So, without further ado, let's begin at the beginning.

1. [2020][11]
2. [2021][12]

### 2022

1. > **Frances Ha | Noam Baumbach | 2012**

Just the kind of movie you want to begin your year with. An innocent, "undateable" Frances, an indescribable friendship, artist's apartment in New York :heart:, "All I have to show are my mistakes", and Frances' expectation out of a relationship monologue. I loved every aspect of it, really.
(first watch: Jan 10th, 2022)

2. > **Edge of Tomorrow | Doug Liman | 2014**

Post midnight movie with friends in the hostel. Interesting premise but solely for entertainment.
(first watch: Jan 16th 2022)

3. > **Her | Spike Jonze | 2013**

Explores the extremes of what it means to love someone. Asks interesting questions. Brilliant cinematography and incredible performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johannson. Didn't disappoint. Found myself drawing haunting similarities with my life.
(first watch: Jan 18th, 2022)

4. > **Friends | Season 10**

All I can say is "Wow". It has been an epic journey full of love and laughter. I learned so much and found so much. It has been an incredible experience.

5. > **Gladiator | Ridley Scott | 2000**

Story of sacrifices, gallantry, bravery, and courage. Signature Ridley Scott. Majestic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and co. Incredible performance by Russell Crowe. Thought I could pause midway but it was too riveting. Watched till 6 in the morning.
(first watch: Jan 21st, 2022)

6. > **Sex Education | Season 01 | 2021**

Netflix production. Is it only me or does Emma Mackey has an uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie? Anyway, I liked how teenage school dramas are becoming more inclusive. Good selection of songs, and pop culture refs. And now, I have made a sizeable addition to my British vocabulary :P.

7. > **Paprika | Satoshi Kon | 2006**

It's obvious that I'm a fan of Satoshi Kon's works. I should have watched this waaay before but anyway. Recommended by a friend. I want to expand my cinematic knowledge to other cultures. BTW, there's a [2021 documentary][13] commemorating Kon's works. Yaaay!
PS: OMG, Susumu Hirasawa's OST is so addicting!
(first watch: Jan 22nd 2022)

8. > **Life in a Day | Ridley Scott and Kevin McDonald | 2010**

Part of a course assignment but really heart-touching movie. People were asked to record a day of their lives in 2010 to record for posterity what it felt like to be alive in 2010. Found it slightly voyeuristic which is part of the appeal I guess. Novel idea. They also did 2020. It hits different the second time you watch it.
(first watch: Jan 23rd, 2022)

9. > **Special Ops | Season 1**

Watched with wingmates in hostel. Entertaining.

10. > **Sex Education | Season 02 | 2021**

It is what it says on the tin but in a manner that is appealing to today's teenagers. It breaks the tradition, cliched (and cringed?) pedagogy of sex education and educates us subtly while concealing behind a teenage drama. Impressive and ingenious. Looking forward to season 3.

11. > **Won't you be my neighbor | Morgan Neville | 2018**

_"Always know that you're loved and are capable of loving"_. I really needed to hear that right now. This is a documentary about Fred Rogers, a minister-to-be from Pittsburg, who by a turn of events got into television which was booming in the 60s. He wrote, produced, and directed _"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood_", a TV program directed at young children. Mr. Rogers' incredible understanding of child psychology coupled with his minsiterial training allowed him to present really sensitive issues like death, validation, and even divorce to young children. I really, really enjoyed getting to know this ambitious and noble man.
PS: This was on my list for a very long time.
(first watch: Feb 1st, 2022)

12. > **Paris vu par (Six in Paris) | 1965**

I have taken to French cinema lately and it has been a rewarding experience so far. The movie at hand is an amalgamation of six different stories directed by six different directors, all capturing the spirit of the beautiful city of Paris. Stories of love, deceit, drama, humor, and even death. The plots are varied and wholesome. Worth rewatching just for the Parisian shots and the language. :heart:
(first watch: Feb 3rd, 2022)

13. > **Friends: The Reunion | 2021**

It was everything I expected it to be and more. It was hilarious to know these funny, little trivia and BTSs. And nostalgic, of course.
(first watch: Feb 5th, 2022)

14. > **Damage | Louis Malle | 1992**

A tale of unbridled passion on the part of an ultra-rich minister coerces him to lose everything he had. Frankly, the plot was too single dimensional and lacking dynamics. Watched it only for Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche :heart:.
(first watch: Feb 10, 2022)

15. > **Sex Education | Season 03 | 2021**

Highly entertaining and thoughtful. Felt like a drag at places. But it ended on another cliffhanger :/

16. > **Deep Throat | Gerard Damiano | 1972**

My eyes. My eyes! MY EYES!! What a terrible day to have eyes.
(first watch: Feb 16, 2022)

17. > **The Worst Person in the World | Joachim Trier | 2021**

Stunning Norway! Each frame is so well-crafted. And then, the superb writing and the performances by Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen. Had a great time.
(first watch: Feb 18th, 2022)

18. > **Endless Love | Shana Feste | 2014**

I think I just needed some pre-majors cinematic recharge and this movie fitted the bill perfectly. No excessive mental overhead, no complex characters to analyse, or exceptional plots. The kind of romantic mushy love-found-lost-found teenage love story that makes you excessively giddy. Yeah, cute story.
(first watch: Mar 3rd, 2022)

19. > **A Walk to Remember | Adam Shankman | 2002**

Just timepass.
Okay. I _need_ to diversify my list!
(first watch: Mar 5th, 2022)

20. > **Licorice Pizza | Paul Thomas Anderson | 2021**

LP is a coming-of-age love story set in the 80s. It chronicles the ups and downs in the relationship of a 25yr old girl with a 15yr old boy and follows both as they seek out their meaning and place in life, the boy involved in petty teenage activities while the girl matured and more pragmatic in her approach to life. Their huge age difference formed a major factor as to how they approached their relationship and most of the movie revolved how they "worked it out". Relatively sparse, quirky events, and a tad bit long, I felt it was a movie designed to pass time.
(first watch: Mar 12th, 2022)

21. > **Spider Man: No Way Home | Jon Watts | 2021**

Great post-production. Storyline sets the backdrop for Multiverse of Madness. Digged the action sequences.
(first watch: Mar 28th, 2022)

22. > **In The Mood For Love | Wong Kar-Wai | 2000**

After I finished the movie, I had this intense want to re-watch the movie again. It's that good. Great story, brilliant cinematography, acting op, soundtrack. I think it all fits in quite well.
(first watch: Mar 30th, 2022)

23. > **Chungking Express | Wong Kar-Wai | 1994**

Someone rightfully said on an online review that "You will like Chungking Express if you like films." Loved the cinematography especially those artsy shots. Also, the soundtrack is nice.
(first watch: Mar 31, 2021)

24. > **Sen Yasamaya Bak (In Good Hands) | Ketche | 2022**

I guess this was my first exploration of Turkish cinema. Okay.
(first watch: Apr 2nd, 2022)

25. > **Zodiac | David Fincher | 2007**

Yet another Fincher classic. Suspenseful right from the first shot up until the end. Leaves the viewer pondering, with that lingering aftertaste of an incomplete, yet perfectly told story. Much to be learned from Fincher.
(first watch: Apr 14th, 2022)

26. > **Fargo | Coen Brothers | 1996**

Fargo is an Oscar-winning "comedy crime thriller". Directed by the brilliant Coen brothers, it's a fictional story of a inept car sales manager who pays a couple of henchmen to kidnap his wife in order to exhort money from his miser father-in-law. However, things go awry and end up pretty badly for everyone. Superb storytelling, that Minnesota accent, the stark white settings, and _Mike Yanagita_ makes this a movie truly deserving of being included in many "Best movies of all times" lists. There are also subtle many subtle references to Alfred Htitchcock and Stanley Kubrick among others.
(first watch: Apr 30th, 2022)

27. > **Lady Bird | Greta Gerwig | 2017**

Funny, balanced, mature. The story of this typical teenager girl from Sacramento who pushes through a financially unsound household, relationship, college, and just existence in general. Enjoyed it.
(first watch: May 2nd, 2022)

28. > **Skyfall | Sam Mendes | 2012**

Typical James Bond movie. Post-minor fallout.
(first watch: May 13, 2022)

29. > **Everything Everywhere All At Once | Kwan and Scheinert | 2022**

Nice concept but I think badly executed. Sick editing and mind-boggling cinematography.
(first watch: May 19th, 2022)

30. > **Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone | Chris Columbus | 2001**

Yes, this is the first time I watched this (stop with the shocked looks already, okay!). I was really meant to read first but time scarcity. Hence.
I really enjoyed the Diagon Alley vibes. Been going through some shit myself and needed somewhere to escape. This perfectly fitted the bill. And then, Emma Watson :purple_heart:
(first watch: May 20th, 2022)

31. > **One Day | Lone Scherfig | 2011**

Had to force myself to stop so I could finish the book first. But worth every bit of it. Anna Hathaway in one of her fine performances. And loved that cockney accent.
(first watch: Jun 02, 2022)

32. > **Breathless | Jean-Luc Godard | 1960**

Hm, what's such a big deal? Oh. Wait. Wow, WTF, this is genius!
(first watch: Jun 07, 2022)

33. > **Millennium Actress | Satoshi Kon | 2001**

Holy cow! I want to kick myself for delaying this gem of a movie for _this_ long. In this movie, Kon tells a romance story in his style, bringing together drama, love, poignance, piquing our interest, keeping us arrested in the disorienting whirlwind that is his _modus operandi_. There is chaos and yet, it doesn't feel chaotic. The blurry line between reality and imagination is a recurring theme in all of Kon's works and in this, it outshines. As Chiyoko remarks at the end, “After all, what I really love is the pursuit of him”, we are forced to rethink the basis of our affection. (first watch: Jun 12, 2022)

34. > **The Platform | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | 2019**

A deeply metaphorical, introspective study of capitalism, exisiting societal structures, and the human nature. Has a quasi religious undertone to it. Intriguing and a good watch.
(first watch: Jun 20, 20222)

35. > **Badlands | Terence Mallick | 1973**

A beautiful film from start to finish. From the writing down to each individual shot, it exudes a sense of artistic appreciation in the executor. Paced and balanced story, had a tough time deciphering the Southern accent (lol), nice soundtrack, great dialogues. Overall, ~justified of being in Ebert's Best Movies list~ a good watch.
(first watch: Jun 23, 2022)

36. > **Scott Pilgrim vs the World | Edgar Wright | 2010**

How do I even begin to describe this cherry of a movie? Imagine someone mixed video games, rock music, and a love story together. The plot, the execution, the brilliant cinematography, the creative editing (which I highly approve of), this movie speaks for something beyond its age. It's a weird movie, no doubt. But in a good way. And that is the best kind of weird, really.
So, the story follows this skinny Canadian boy called Scott Pilgrim who's reeling from past breakup and own problems when he meets Ramona Flowers, an American hipster and instantly falls in love with her. But he must defeat every member of the League of Evil Exes to get to be with her. It's the kind of boy-meet-girl, fall-in-love, can't-be-together, fight-against-all-odds, now-together, happy ending, reimagined.
And, the characters OMG! (And Mary Elizabeth's Ramona is so hot (LOL))
PS: There are seven of Ramona's exes.
PPS: Every teenager should watch this movie atleast once!
PPPS: And why only teenagers? (OK, I'm too excited but it's a good movie, I can't help it. Ok, bye)
(first watch: Jun 26, 2022)

37. > **Heat | Micheal Mann | 1995**

Set in LA, _Heat_ is the classic police-and-theif chase story with a heart. Follows Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro) as he crafts master plans to rob banks, and execute dissidents, manage a personal life, etc. with Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a LAPD Homicide officer on his tail. It's a great movie on so many levels. Great writing, cinematography, acting. It managed to keep me at the edge of my seat till 3:30 AM (LOL). Great movie for a Saturday night with friends.
(first watch: Jun 27, 2022)

38. > **Lost and Delirious | Leo Pool | 2001**

The story follows two teenager girls who are in love with each other but then one decides to act on the _"log kya kahenge"_ narrative which leaves the other girl distraught. The movie essentially explores the intense disheaval and delirium that the lose of a lover can bring. I think the writing was disbalanced because the characters weren't realised to their full potential (For eg: the head mistress and her side-kick). I can imagine that it must have been "blasphemous" for a 2K1 audience for it does have few "bold" scenes. Also have to mention that Indian song/composition by Yves Chamberland which seems so out of place. Since it is unnamed, I couldn't find translation for the lyrics which is so sad. Yes, now I'm gonna go and read Macbeth :P
PS: It doesn't end well.
PPS: Yes, this is me celebrating pride month at the end because exams :cry:
(first watch: Jun 30, 2022)

39. > **Mad Max: Fury Road | George Miller | 2015**

This is _the_ definition of action-packed. Amazing movie from all respects. Loved it. Can rewatch anytime. No breakthorughs in terms of technique or cinematography but exceptional usage of existing ones. Brilliant writing of course, and editing. Now I know what the hype is all about. Again, couldn't take my eyes off it (!)
(first watch: July 2nd, 2022)

40. > **American Psycho | Mary Harron | 2000**

_American Psycho_ is a open-ended, metaphorical study of the American capitalist mindset. It takes the idea of the quintessential Wall Street banker and stretches that to its extreme. It is beyond doubt that this movie counts among the finest of modern cult classics. The suspense, the drama, the sheer terror of it all, the constant pinging question of the fate of the next person Patrick Bateman would meet. Bateman stands in the company of the finest villains such as Anton Chigurh, John Doe, and Hannibal Lecter. His presence in the frame itself is terrifying and to achieve such effect requires a mastery of the craft. I admit that the ending is ambigous. We never know if it was Bateman's imagination or for real but I think that makes sense because in the high-class, ultra-rich American bourgeois circles, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. We see that detective Kimball was unable to link any of the murders back to Bateman and just to add to your annoyance, _none_ of the "murders" committed by Patrick were seen by other people on screen. So, is Bateman the metaphorical representation of the American rich dog who is above law and order and can get away with any crime, no matter how heinous or is he the representation of the over-clocked American workman who has lost it under anxiety and tension?
I watched this with a friend and totally enjoyed it. Brilliant cinematography for eg: the casual shot of Bateman opening his refrigerator door to reveal a severed female head wrapped in plastic or the stored dead female bodies in his closet. It's how quickly Harron was able to escalate situations that makes this movie a super edgy watch.    


#### Review 2 that I wrote for college newsletter: 

American Psycho is an open-ended, metaphorical study of the American capitalist mindset. It explores the limits of the psychological derangement of the quintessential Wall Street banker. The tantalizing question of the fate of the next person Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) encounters keeps the viewers on their toes. Bateman stands in the company of some of the greatest villains of all time: Anton Chigurh (No Country for Old Men), John Doe (Se7en), and Hannibal Lecter (Silence of the Lambs).

Bale’s calm and cold demeanor lends a chilling edge to his character. We never find out if the events shown were fictitious or real, which mirrors the blurred line between fact and fiction in aloof aristocratic circles, American or not. We see that detective Kimball was unable to link any of the murders to Bateman, and to add to one’s annoyance, none of the "murders" committed by Patrick were seen by anybody else on screen.    

Is Bateman the representation of the opulent, entitled American who can get away with any crime, regardless of how heinous it is, or the overclocked American workman driven to insanity by anxiety and tension?

Brace yourself, as Bateman sermonizes his victims to the music of “Huey Lewis and the News” or Whitney Houston in one scene and axes them in the next; or as he opens his refrigerator to casually reveal severed female heads wrapped in plastic. Psycho, without doubt, justifies itself as a modern cult classic.   

(first watch: July 2nd 2022)

41. > **Pitch Perfect | Jason Moore | 2012**

A modern musical based on the A Capella style of music making. Enjoyed the witty dialogues and the deadpan, sometimes dark humour. Character arcs were explicit and it was fun to revisit contemporary songs in an A capella setting. Watched it with a friend and learnt a lot of A capella-terms. A-ca-awesome (!)
(first watch: Jul 4th, 2022)

42. > **When Harry Met Sally | Rob Reiner | 1989**

Well, another classic off my list I suppose :p But it's a hilarious and touching movie. Laughed so hard at the fake Sally orgasm in the deli scene.

(first watch: Jul 5th, 2022)

43. > **Little Women | Greta Gerwig | 2019**

Wow, so many memorable lines. I really should have read the book :P They mean well when they say read the classics. One would actually want to live with the March sisters as they go about their business. Each sister is so well developed as a character and Alcott diversifed so well that every teenage girl, irrespective of their era, would be able to identify themselves with one of them. Love the conflict in Jo March's character. "I want to be great, or nothing" is so well-spoken. And then you have, "Writing doesn't confer importance, it reflects it". Cherry of a movie. Definitely watchable with kids around.

(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)

44. > **Blue is the Warmest Color | Abdellatif Kechiche | 2013**

Ok. I can understand now what the protests were all about when this came out 9 years ago. The male director _does_ seem to border on fetishizing lesbians. Other than that, I think it's a great movie nevertheless, although a tad too long.   

PS: I Follow Rivers is such an earworm, OMG!!    

(first watch: Jul 10th, 2022)

45. > **District 9 | Neill Blomkamp | 2009**

Entertaining. Contains strong graphic violence. Liked the character arc.

(first watch: Jul 17th, 2022)

46. > **But I'm the Cheerleader | Jamie Babbit | 1999**

What's this movie LMFAO? It's so weird and cringey and unfinished. So, basically, a group of homosexuals are sent to a therapy school called 'True Directions' which is headed by a hot-headed (read: humorous) headmistress Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) who believes in the simple "five step" solution to "cure" homosexuality as if it's a disease. Very cringey writing, humorous and memorable characters. Overall, a funny movie.

(first watch: Jul 18th, 2022)

47. > **Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness | Sam Raimi | 2022**

I expect MCU to deliver monotonuous, cookie-cutter, feel-good movies and it never disappoints. Great for when I want to "switch off" my brain. Also, WTF Wanda?

(first watch: Jul 19th, 2022)

48. > **Phantom Thread | Paul Thomas Anderson | 2017**

Reynolds Woodcock is a successful fashion designer who is also a pain in the ass. A man who lost his mother at a young age and misses dearly, he is the antithesis of what he projects on the outside, when he's alone. The plot follows him and Alma Elson, an indomitable local waitress as they fall in love despite their differences and is beautifully told. There are some innovative camera shots in this movie.

(first watch: Jul 20th, 2022)

49. > **Arrival | Denis Villeneuve | 2016**

_Arrival_ is Ted Chiang's novella "Story of your life" adapted for the screen. Told in a non-linear chronological order by a Dr. Louise Banks, an accomplished linguist as she recalls events of the past and yet something of her manner of talking is disconcerting. She talks in "You'd" and "I'll" as if she's _already_ aware of what will happen. And indeed, the movie explores the themes of determinism, free-will, and eventually Cassandra complex in the behaviour of its protagonist, Louise. There is ample food for thought to the budding linguists in the language and its consequent decipherment of the "Heptapods" - the creatures who arrived. Amazing perfomances by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner (playing Dr. Ian Donnelly) alongwith brilliant direction from Villeneuve who is known for masterfully directing thrillers. Coherent and wholesome.

(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)

50. > **Inglorious Basterds | Quentin Tarantino | 2009**

By style and execution, this is a Tarantino all the way down (The skillfully directed strudel scene with Landa and Shoshanna in a confrontational ballet (contrary to the popular opinion of the opening chapter which is still great nevertheless)). Divided into chapters, it tells the fictional story of a group of Jewish-American-Italian rebel group that goes about terrorizing the Nazis of occupied France and the chase by Herr Hans Landa, an SS officer and the main antagonist of the movie. _Basterds_ lacked the chaotic harmony of _Pulp fiction_ where Tarantino masterfully weaved multiple plots and storyline into a cohesive whole. In that respect, _Basterds_ is a less ambitious ordeal. But let that not fool you from the exceptional cinematography and brilliant shots and compositions that once again proves Tarantino as a master of his art (Cue in the shot of a hesitant Shoshanna resting against a huge window). The characters of Landa and Adolf Hilter himself, written in their incredulously humorous and dumb-witted fashion, were reminiscient of Taika Waititi's another great movie, _Jojo Rabbit_. Great anti-war story with humour but I presume that is only to counter the explicit gore and violence that is one of Tarantino's regular motifs.

(first watch: Jul 21st, 2022)

51. > **Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaara | Zoya Akhtar | 2011**

This. Movie. Is. A. Vibe. Amazingly writing, beautifully directed. Loved the poetry, the drama, the locales. One of those few pieces of art that makes you want to leave everything behind, pack your bags, and just head out. Kerouac's _On the Road_ made me feel this way too. Definitely rewatchable!

(first watch: Jul 23rd, 2022)

52. > **Rashomon | Akira Kurosawa | 1950**

My introduction to Kurosawa. _Rashomon_ is quite an accessible piece among his works. Loved it for the vivid emotions and the residual influence of silent films. That iconic "woodcutter walking into the forest" scene is visual pleasure for the cinephile. And I suppose there is enough said and analysed about the meaning of the plot, the puzzle of the "true" murderer, and the nature of objective truth and human psychology itself. In ~88 minutes, Akira Kurosawa takes us into a world bordering on the mystic and supernatural and shows us the power of ingenious cinematography, camera movements, and clever editing.
PS: A more critical piece is in the pipeline.

54. > **La nuit americaine (Day for Night) | Francois Truffaut | 1973**

_Day for Night_ opens to what sounds like a conductor orchestrating an arrangement.  Cuts to a livid and bustling Parisian avenue in the daylight as the camera follows a man who follows and slaps another man._"CUT!"_ and we snap back to reality &ndash; a scene was shot. _Day for Night_, which borrows its name from a filmmaking technique that is used to shoot night scenes in daytime, is a film about films by the acclaimed French New Wave director, Francois Truffaut.

The rich French culture of appreciation of films as work of art shines through in this visual storytelling that verges on the metaphysical portraiture of making films itself. We follow director Ferrand (Francois Truffuat) as he fends a number of personal and professional problems of himself, the cast, and the crew to shoot a film called _"Meet Pamela"_ &ndash; an adulterous tale in which the hero's fiancee falls in love with his father.

In a voiceover he rhetorically asks: **"What is a director? Someone who's asked endless questions about everything."** and goes on to prove the validity of his answer. The film beautifully captures the multitude of things going wrong, taking unexpected turns, the improvisations, the cast whims, the cast breakdowns, crew management, the logistics, the producer, the studio, and what not. I strongly believe any budding filmmaker should watch this film atleast once.

What I appreciated was the fact that inspite of all hurdles, Truffaut manages to sneak in the fantasized, dream-like quality of cinema. Be it the bundle of book on filmmaking he got in order or montages of shooting set in beautiful composition accompanied by majestic upbeat music by composer Georges Delerue. He takes pride in his art like an artist in his painting. Ferrand's a restless detective, drawing inspiration from even the mundanities of existence. During the shoot, he improvises words spoken by the lead actress during her personal breakdown and introduced them as dialogues for her character! Or when he steals a blue vase from the hotel because it would fit perfectly in the scene. To be honest, it is difficult to point out where Ferrand ends and where Truffaut begins. A bit mischeivous, a bit crazy.

Filmmaking is a difficult job and perhaps, the job of the director the hardest.
This movie is a great starting point to begin to understand that.

55. > **Irreversible | Gaspar Noe | 2002**

Gaspar Noe is known for commenting on sensitive topics via heavily experimental, avant-garde films. In **"Irreversible"**, he undertakes the task of telling the story of an ugly and horrifying night in the life of a couple in reverse chronological order. We meet _Marcus_, wild and aggressive, who seems on the verge of a mental collapse, running across the city chasing someone by the name of Tenia. He's _the_ embodiment of aggression and violence: trashing, punching, smashing people's heads. The frames captures raw emotions, a dillusioned Marcus as Noe tries to convey his world collapsing by swirling his camera all over the subject and beyond. The camera movement seems forced and annoying compelling us to empathise with the fact that all is not well in Marcus's life and suddenly, the movements start to feel like poetic. The only point of calmness is his friend, Pierre, who accompanies him through the cacophonic night.

Marcus' girlfriend, Alex, was raped and killed in the subway while Marcus and Pierre were at a party. Alex was fed up by a drunken Marcus and left for home alone. She was suggested to take the subway to cross the road as it was "safer". The shocking and terrifying 9 minute long rape scene shook the Cannes audience way back in 2002. And yet, it is so enraging and horrifying to realise that this is how it happens when it does.

The movie takes a peaceful turn in the second half as Gaspar elucidates the relationship between Alex and Marcus. Their bedroom scene is so pregnant with irony; when Alex vehemantly disagrees to be treated like an object men can pass around; or when she smirks at Pierre, her ex, when asked about her sex life with Marcus. The smirk of a woman who prides herself in the secrets she keeps. Something broke in my heart when she said, _"It's always the woman who decides"_. It is a well-written balance to the first half where Marcus rummages through the wastelands of Paris, through filthy sex clubs, through depraved souls, and through smashing skulls.

Gaspar Noe learnt everything in film school just to make sure he never uses them. I talked about the camera, floating in space like a spectre. There is a loud wailing noise in the background at all times. The color palatte is dark. We see subjects in glimpses.

PS: Heavy violence, gore, sexual content. Highly disturbing (like all Noe movies). Watch at your discretion.

(first watch: 4th August, 2022)

56. > **The 400 Blows | Francois Truffaut | 1959**
A classic that helped kick-start French New Wave. I loved the story and cinematography. It's a movie that celebrates childhood, Paris, and the audacity to not listen. Loved it really.
(first watch: 6th August, 2022)

57. > **Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? | Mike Nichols | 1966**
_Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ is an American theatrical piece by Edward Albee adapted for the screen. It explores the dysfunctional marriage of a history professor and his infertile, tumoultous wife whilst commenting on other existential issues like facing realities and the nature of illusion and lies.

The play is set mostly in George and Martha's house where they receive a young, newly-wed couple, Nick, who is a professor in the Biology Department, and Honey, his "slim-hipped" wife after a party hosted by Martha's father and head of Institute. The ensuing conversation between these two couples and a number of scandalous, heart-breaking, and vicious events turn the night into a despicable hell-hole. The characters are rich in complexities and multi-layered who can be dissected for a long time and provide ample food for discussion.

The central piece of the play is George and Martha's marriage and the hundred ways they cannot survive each other and yet surprisingly have stuck together for so long. It's a childless marriage and a truth Marta chooses to hide by conjuring a phantom son who is sixteen years old. George was once an ambitious young man who has a wild childhood, and has failed to achieve much in life eventually to live off his father-in-law's money, a fact Martha cruelly points out and it seems, likes to take pride in. Out of frustration, the couple lacerates each other and their guests in multiple avenues through the night. It is, to say the least, painful to watch. Words turn to acid that dissolves any affection, gestures turned murderous and appalling. George eventually breaks the reality to Martha that is, that they have no children, a fact that seem to finally cap the excited, nymphous middle-aged woman.

There is love between George and Martha when she, in one of her spontaneous fits, confesses her love for George in a very poignant and deep monologue.

> Martha: Whom I will not forgive for having come to rest.

> For having seen me and having said "Yes, this will do."

> Who has made the hideous, the hurting the insulting mistake of loving me.

> And must be punished for it.

> ~_Who's Afriad of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee_

Virginia Woolf stood as a woman who preferred to face realities instead of living in illusions. Hence, the curious title of the play eventually translates to: "Who is afriad of facing realities?", an appropriate title to the play and made more stark when Martha says, "I am. I am" in her closing lines. It leaves us wondering whether we are afriad of Virginia Woolf too.

Wacky. Signature Tarantino style. Motifs of food, feet, and refreshing cinematography. Coupled with striking shots and engaging storytelling.

Ditto Vol. 1. Tarantino movies are immensely rewatchable not only from the entertainment perspective which makes them accessible to the inexperienced but also serve as study material for the budding filmmakers.

60. > **Vertigo | Alfred Hitchcock | 1958**

I can understand why this movie is included in the list of "greatest films ever made" and is included in the case study of every budding filmmaker. This movie did things differently for the first time. Introduced innovative cinematographic techniques (such as the "dolly" shot) that became the standard in every filmmaker's toolkit. Pioneered computer graphic usage in films. In a way, it was one of the films that wrote how films should be made and which was how films were made for a long time. There is a residual and quite distinct 50s character and style to the film.

Film was a relatively new medium of expression and it shows. From acting to the continuation of shots. The concept of "getting into a character" was meagrely defined and was still being developed. Actions sometimes just feel "empty". Camerawork, although revolutionary, was still not complete. The ability to storytell a scene via a collection of shots, though polished by Hitchcock, was still not _there_. This is very prominently portrayed by the last scene after the nun finds out two strangers on the bell-tower attic. So out of place, it made me laugh.

Loved the suspense. Loved the music and design. The compositions were marvellous. Hitchcock was a master of creating suspense. This movie shows how its done.

61. > **Liberal Arts | Josh Radnor | 6.7**

Saw a post on Instagram about the "We should hug" scene from this movie and I instantly knew that I _had_ to watch it. Brilliant writing. The dialogues are _chef's kiss_. The movie explores the themes of growing up, adulthood, and accepting changes. It tracks the life of a timid clerk who revisits his alma mater and attracts the attention of a college sophomore while soaking in his own nostalgia of college life and simultaneously battling the tinging realization of the irretrievable past. I could connect better with this movie probably because I'm in college but dude, those dialogues.

And many more. Also, did I vent how beautiful I think the title of the movie is. ~~Should have gone to an art school.~~

62. > **Barry Lyndon | Stanley Kubrick | 8.1**   

_Barry Lyndon_ is a period drama set in 1700s England during the reign of George, the third. It is the story of an unknown young and ambitious man who through his cunning and bravado achieves much and just as quickly loses everything, as men often tend to become fools and meek after the attainment of a certain portion of wealth and fortune.     

The film is a great starting place to study composition in films. The elaborate settings, the costumes, the props, the posture - Kubrick shows his meticule and attention to detail. The repeating motif of pull back shots is a characteristic of this film (The pull-back shot is generally used to reveal location around the vicinity of a character and/or serve as establishing shots). The masterful use of pull backs can be studied to understand when and when not to use a pull back. Loved it.

63. > **Vivre sa vie | Jean Luc-Godard | 7.9**   

_Vivre sa vie_ (My life to live) follows a young girl as she descents into the occupation of prostitution. The story untolds in a set of 12 labelled tableaux (scenes but more disjoint in time and space). This film is a product of the French New Wave phenomenon and it is evident from the unorthodox camera movements, avant-garde cuts (cue in the ingenious gun shot scene with Nana in the cafe and Raoul outside). Tracking shots, gyrating shots, extreme bird view tracking shots, and static, almost fixated close-up shots with a disregard to the environment (often without any establishing shots), all of which helped establish _Vivre sa vie_ as an iconic New Wave film. The chemistry and tumultous relationship between Godard and Anna Karina cannot be overlooked in any conversation involving the New Wave simply because of her creative influence on Godard in the creation of the new style. 

In _Vivre sa vie_, she uses style, body language, and facial expressions to express the apprehensions of a struggling Parisian woman trying to make both ends meet. I personally loved the conversation with the philosopher (the 11th tableaux). The last tableaux is reminiscient of "Breathless" (the parallel will be obvious to those who have watched it; I will leave it to others to find out). A film about life and love. An art film.

64. > **Mulholland Drive | David Lynch | 8.2**   
My introduction to David Lynch. Let me be honest that I have been prepetually stalling this director only to watch one of his magnus opus on an inpulsive spree. And boy, oh boy, it's incredible. Gave me literal chills. Horror, suspense, atmosphere, setting, hot lead actresses, mind-fucking thriller. All the hype I heard about MD being able to conjure successfully one of the most suspenseful atmosphere is, in fact, true.     
A great first watch of Lynch. Blue velvet next ;)

65. > **Wreck-It Ralph | Rich Moore | 7.7**    
One of the feel-good movies, something I can count on Disney to provide when I need them the most. Amazing story, great character chemistry, the dialogues, the character design, the animation, sound design, the art, the creativity dude, the creativity. Loved it.

66. > **Ralph breaks the internet | Rich Moore, Phil Johnston | 7**

(first watch: 8th September, 2022)   

67. > **Tokyo Godfathers | Satoshi Kon | 7.8**     
This remained on my list for a very long time. All Kon movies are delightful from his efforts in going that extra mile for the characters, to wholesome stories, and cinematography. Kon is a master of his medium.    

In Tokyo Godfathers, he chooses to tell the story of three homeless bums who couldn't be more different but somehow manage to stick around - a drinker and gambler who left his family, a homosexual, needy man, and a stubborn teenager who ran away from home after she stabbed her father. The story chronicles their journey through Tokyo of trying to find the mother of an abandoned child on Christmas and how they eventually the child's godfathers.    

Kon explores the theme of mother's love but the theme is so subtle and fleeting that one only comes to terms with it at the climax. And I think that is ingenious and a nice way to outstand from the herd where the trope of "mother's love" sits glaring front and centre, literal death by boredom. Kon keeps us so sufficiently distracted in all the happenings, the quirky characters, the action, the shocking twists to sneakily plant the theme in place.    

Kon also takes liberty to sermonize us through the characters on love, life, people. However, compared to his previous works like _Perfect Blue_, _Millenium Actress_, or _Paprika_, he lets his illusionist edge take a back-seat. The story is top-notch and real, and he chooses to put _that_ front and centre. I loved it!   

(first watch: 9th September, 2022)     

68. > **Call Me By Your Name | Luca Guadagnino | 7.8**     
_CMBYN_ is a love story told in the span of a summer between a teenage boy and a researcher who is spending the summer with the boy's father, an anthropology (linguistics?) professor. It's a beautiful film, from the shots to the composition of scenes. I liked that aspect. It does a commendable job of capturing the anxiousness, apprehensions of immature experience of first love. 

The centrepiece of the movie is Elio, the awkward, nervous lover-boy. He transcribes music, reads a hell lot of books, swims, doesn't respond very well to invitations of love, is not competent enough to express his own, dozes off after jerking off, is excessively horny, does weird things when he's around a lover, in short: he's a schoolboy. PS: At one point, he is told to "grow up".   

On another note, Marzia (Esther Garrel). Oh. My. Fucking. God.    

Too slow for _my_ tastes but I guess that is by design. I actually left it midway some time back and completed it today.

69. > **North By Northwest | Alfred Hitchcock | 8.3**    

A trademark Hitchcock. A gripping mystery, a hero chase, beautiful heroine in distress, generous dollops of misogyny, engaging rhythm, creative cinematography. It was a good story that got complimented by the conversion to the film medium by Hitchcock and not the other way around. But what really stood out for me was the subtle misogyny and treatment of women by Hitchcock in his films:   

> Eve: I'm a big girl.   
Thornbill: Yeah, and in all the right places too.  

WTF? 

Or this,

70. > **My Sassy Girl | Jae-young Kwak | 2001**   

Based on the true story of a boy's relationship that he wrote about on his blog, MSG was a phenomenal success in Korea when it was released. And now, when I have watched it, I can see why. It is quirky, hilarious, and heart-warming. It manages to overturn typical stereotypes of the society back then too. With a relationship in jeopardy, let's just say it's something I needed at this point.   

PS: Extra points for that car drive scene and the resolution at the end.

71. > **Vantage Point | Pete Travis | 2008**    

A refreshing new idea. So, the film is essentially a retelling of the story of the assassination of the POTUS at a peace summit in Spain through, you guessed it, multiple vantage points. Pete artfully divulges new information through these people's perspective, kinda mimicking how no one agent in a system has complete information about an event but rather is distributed. This quality of an unreliable source of truth has often hastened critics to draw comparisons with Kurosawa's _Rashomon_ but I suppose that is too hasty and ill-founded. The _Rashomon effect_ referred to the absence of confidence in the account of any narrator of an event. With a little thought, it can be seen that _Vantage Point_ is not the same as the different vantage point only divulges more _and coherent_ information about the truth that is generally agreed upon. It can be, interpreted as, an innovative mode of narration and sure, something that kept me engaged till the very end.

72. > **Waking Life | Richard Linklater | 2001**   

_Waking Life_ is an introspective and rich movie commemorating and simultaneously examining human life and existence in general. There is no plot as such and nothing "progresses" in a conventional way. The protagonist is dreaming and talking to a number of people who are sermonizing him on a variety of topics, deep philosophical questions that loosely try to answer, "What are we?". Linklater comments on linguistics, on morality, evolution, existentialism, the mind, politics, democracy (or lack thereof), of raw human emotions like hunger, anger, frustration, and what they lead to like murders, bombings, and war. There are two shots - one of a man who while talking to the protagonist on a sidewalk, sets himself on fire in broad daylight and another seemingly innocuous conversation between two pals in a bar which escalated into both shooting at each other. The pace of the movie is slow but it lends itself well to be watched at 1.5x or even 2x, just to keep one on their toes.    

Linklater is known for creating immersive experiences out of human conversations (_Before Sunset_) and he does that here as well. Of course, it is futile to talk about this movie without talking about the unique visual style. I think it was a nice decision to animate the movie so as to allow that degree of freedom in more creatively expressing the dream-like premise in which the story unfolds. Kudos to the animator team. Loved those disorienting environment shifts, the floating buildings and trees. That had an enchanting effect on me personally.    

My first impression was: Cool-ass movie where people ask deep philosophical questions. That still holds good.   

(first watch: 17 September, 2022)   

73. > **Paterson | Jim Jarmusch | 2016**     

If I have to summarise this movie in one line: "The story of a modern man". That may sound bland and simple but it isn't. This movie follows a bus driver, Paterson (Adam driver) in the eponymous city of Paterson, New Jersey. He cuddles his wife in bed, wakes up at past 6, goes to work, takes his dog for a walk, hangs out in the bar. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with his life and then you realise that is exactly what _is_ wrong with his life. He is a poet and writes in free-verse in his "secret notebook". A girl calls him, "A bus driver that likes Emily Dickinson". He rarely smiles or laughs and when he does, he's careful to draw back. Maybe it's difficulty to communicate with others, maybe it's loneliness. he loves his wife, loves his job, likes to listen to people having conversations on the bus - draws inspiration from everything around him. He's a poet, after all.    

His wife has big dreams. Wants to be a country star, bakes cupcakes that are a hit at a local community and earns her $286. The small wins that accrue. Revels in the rich history and heritage of his city. It's a movie that will make one think deeply about things. Or maybe not. But that's not the point.   

(first watch: 20th September, 2022)    

74. > **Loves of a Blonde | Milos Forman | 1965**    

_Loves of a Blonde_ is Forman's concerns vocalised about an Eastern Czechoslovakia that is lagging behind its contemporary Western counterparts. He employs a number of elements to convey that apprehension. Being a jazz fan, he points out how Slovaks were still using traditional music in ballrooms whereas _Beatlemania_ was raging in Western blocs (It was the 1960s, after all). He talks about the perception of sexual relations in contemporary Czechoslovak, consequent perception of woman, their doubts and concerns, outdated seduction practices. But at the same time, we see Andula, the heroine rebelling and making herself an active participant in her sexual lifestyle (supposedly a controversial idea at that time). We see her in an almost naked frontal shot, vivid and bright, like a fearless independent woman.    

I like to think it was Forman silently talking about the next generation of Czechs waking up from their isolated worldviews to their Western counterparts and slowly coming to speed with the modern world. And of course, there is no dramatic plot or character transformation, although it is a feature. Overall, a gentle introduction to Czech cinema for me.    

(first watch: 19th September, 2022)    

75. > **Blue Velvet | David Lynch | 1986**    

_Blue Velvet_ is an American thriller neo-noir. Set in a small town called Lumberton, we are introduced to a potentially unstable masochist singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) via the protagonist, Jeffrey, who has returned to town and has conveniently started romancing the local detective's daughter (Laura Dern). With the romance of Jeffrey and Sandy forming a distracting side-plot, Lynch tells the story of Dorothy and Frank, "a very sick and dangerous man", via, again, Jeffrey who is someone of a "mystery lover", breaking into apartments and following criminals in the night. Frank has made a sexual slave out of Dorothy by blackmailing her about her kidnapped husband and son. Frank is killed. Dorothy returns back to sanity after uniting with her son and Jeffrey and Sandy are a thing.    

Drawing obvious parallels between _Blue Velvet_ and _Mulholland Drive_, I was better able to understand Lynch's style, cinematography, and mind. Innocuous objects are lent a chilling dimension, common places (the stairway to Dorothy's apartment, for example) are casted into mysterious and malicious environments, while characters hold central stage in stylization and dialogues as they enrapture the audience from the beginning. Of course, none of these contribute to the plot but manages to instantaneously heighten the suspense and drama of a scene, something Hitchcock would be extremely proud of. _Blue Velvet_ has its share of absurdity and weirdness. For example; why the hell was that hooker dancing on top of the car while Jeffrey was being assaulted by Frank? The strong and lasting imageries that Lynch creates stems from his ability to appeal to the sensual and inherently absurd quality of the human mind. Sensuality, sexuality, the "primal instinct" (Remember Frank's "I'll fuck anything that moves"?), destruction, crime are such an important theme of the film. it is how Lynch views modern society, full of crime and lust - "a strange world". Kudos to Isabelle R for incredible and bold portraiture of a disheveled mother and wife - a character of conflict herself when she cannot decide if she should report to the police or give in to her own pleasures that she draws from being slapped and beaten.    

Mixed feelings about how I _feel_ about this movie but in any case, it's a must-watch. Masterpiece? I won't go so far (That would be _Mulholland Drive_ if anything). Managed to inspire Tarantino, Coen brothers, and the like. Influential. Yes, that.   

_"It's a strange world"_ is a recurrent dialogue in the movie. It really is. I think the movie is Lynch's expression of personal anguish of finding himself in a strange world and counting on the robins to arrive. Something we all can identify with, I suppose.     

(first watch: 23rd September, 2022)   

76. > **Psycho | Alfred Hitchcock | 1960**   

_"We all go a little mad sometimes"_, notes Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the lonely owner of Bates Motel, a secluded motel off the highway and the unfateful place where Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) decides to spend the night while on the run after stealing $40,000 from her boss. I think this dialogue summarizes _Psycho_, Alfred Hitchcock's seminal 1960 work investigating the human tendency to bend towards evil and malice. Marion found herself commiting theft and betraying her boss of 10 years just for some money. Bates is a most interesting character for analysis. A lonely, young man who is something of a goof (or atleast that was our first impression of him). With strong the-boy-next-door vibes, he casually puts his hands in his jeans, shows genuine concern for his customers, and radiates that infectious smile all around. And then of course, Bates' mother, the central enigma of the film. I'll argue we all have a Mrs. Bate equivalent in ourselves (if you know what I mean) and it is this connection that gives such massive appeal to _Psycho_ almost 60 years after its release. Hitchcock brings together our most primal fears and serves them to us in a shocking and mesmerizing platter.  

The shower murder scene is one of the most iconic shots in cinematic history and for a reason, indeed. It showed posterity how actions can be shot. By making the audience a _part_ of the scene (an idea Hitchcock was a big fan of). The jump cuts, the scream, the grimacing face of Marion, the glint of the knife, and the blood flowing down the drain. It's just so meticulously done. _Psycho_ has its share of glass-ceiling breaking moments when Hitchcock kills off the heroine of the film one-third way through the film. A shocking decision that only intrigues us more. The second murder of the private detective Argobast, is cool in itself, a bird-eye shot of the event captured in its entirety, spontaneity and all. The usage of reverse projection to give us the perception of Argobast falling down the stairs. Usage of avant-garde cinematic techniques is something Hitchcock loved to experiment with (The CGI of _Vertigo_, unmistakenly, comes to mind).      

A passing mention of the Bates house, an architecture inspired by Edward Hopper's 1925 _House by the Railroad_, a chilling architectural equivalent representation of the occupant of the house. Hitchcock spent considerable efforts to craft a greatly detailed and almost impeccable mise-en-scene. It all adds up to the final effect that _Psycho_ has on our psyche that is never left the same.   

Another motif that deserves mention is Hitchcock's fetish for voyeurism. Be it the camera scanning the skyline of Phoenix to narrow down into a hotel room where Marion and Loomis are having an illicit love affair. Or, Bates peeping into Cabin 1 through a hole in the wall (suggesting peeping into his customer's lives is one of his pasttimes. Taxidermy being the "obvious" other) to find a half-naked Marion stripping, a beautiful creature I must give in to that and what arouses Bates desire and sets the plot in effective motion.   

One tiny rant: I think the explanation at the climax by the psychatrist was an overkill and unnecessary. With a movie that relies so heavily on suspense and cliff-hangers, it would have only made more sense if Hitchcock had decided to let the audience connect the dots for themselves by just giving them enough morsel for thought. But it might have been Hitchcock paranoid about masses not being able to understand his film, a constant paranoid for artists, I suppose. Premise felt similar to Agatha Christie's _Mousetrap_. And, the initial premise of Marion finally realizing her mistake of stealing money bore too great a resemblance to Selma Lagerlorf's short story _Rattrap_, a text I remember from my school curriculum.   

_"We all go a little mad sometimes"_. Yes, and _Psycho_ confronts (celebrates?) that upfront and close.     

(first watch: 24 September, 2022)   

77. > **Fantastic Mr. Fox | Wes Anderson | 2009**    

A rather curious visual style adopted by Wes Anderson that is reminiscient of 3D stop-motion with clay models.   

Once in a while, it is uplifting to watch movies like _Mr. Fox_, within which you can get lost and take a break. A reverse Icarus character arc, adorable characterizations, and the visual style. That's what I remember.    

Oh, and this :P

78. > **Four Lions | Chris Morris | 2010**   

_Four Lions_ is a British dark comedy satire commenting on the state of Islamic terrorism in the UK, their perception by the general crowd, and the eminent danger they pose today. I cannot begin to describe how cleverly written and well-researched this film is. I was laughing so hard in places.  

The plot shows four (five actually) Muslims in London who are wannabe terrorists and how they want the ummah to rise up, their disgust for homosexuality, collective hatred towards consumerist, capitalist Western culture, and on and on. I don't wanna spoil it for you but it's a must-watch. What it manages to do is develop a powerful message about a controversial and sensitive topic in a humorous and light-hearted package.  

Sample this: "Just because I'm a Muslim, you thought it was real?"    

(first watch: 26 September, 2022)    

79. > **Reservoir Dogs | Quentin Tarantino | 1992**   

A bank robbery gone wrong. In Tarantino land. Identifiable motifs - men in black, car trunk scene, generous dollops of gore and violence, blood, blood, blood, gunshots, distrust, and a phasic narration style.    

Six ragtags men are assembled to pull a daylight diamond heist but the maneuver goes wrong as police bust their plans. The story picks from this point where characters deliberate, ponder, and fight over the existence and identity of an undercover cop amongst them. Distrust, fear, and suspense are held in these scenes meticulously, in their carefully crafted dialogues to their behaviours. Sandwiched between these dialogues which mostly unfolds in a warehouse garage, Quentin tells the backstory of these goons. Quentin shows how creating good cinema does not require elaborate sets or a big bulky budget.    

And that climax, OMG.   

(first watch: 27 September, 2022)   

80. > **A Trip to the Moon | Georges Meiles | 1902**    

Oh, so finally we're here. At the beginning. This 15 minute science-fiction short is what most cinema historians consider as the realisation of the art of the moving camera as a form of art. It is plenty evident from the style, presentation, and techniques of an early explorer's pioneering efforts. As if they are surveying a new found medium, defining new limits and new "laws". The remnants of theaters are obvious too. Meiles was more of an illusionist than a director just like directors of his era. The idea of expression realism developed much later but the basic gist of cinema remains unchanged (and which we find stark and central stage in 'Le Voyage das la Lune'): story-telling.     

Georges was an absurdist, and a visionary. There are long static and wide shots, strictly defining the boundaries of what's in frame and what's not. The realisation that the frame _itself_ can be dynamic through the film was unknown to these early adopters. The claustrophobic shots is one of the features that stood out for me, along with interesting camera trickery that gave varied effects on screen (superimposition of the human face on the moon, perhaps one of the most iconic cinematic images). It is ironic to think how just seventy years from when we specualated of going to the moon, we actually did go to the moon.     

Another interesting exercise, as I was led to believe online, is an interpretation of ATTTM. Most accepted theory is Meiles criticizing man as a bringer of chaos and highlights the destructive nature of man. They "invaded" moon and crashed into the moon-people uninvited. We may choose to laud these gentlemen on Earth for their accomplishment and bravery, but as soon as images of the moustacheod professor/astronaut spanking moon-residents with his umbrella kicks in as they disappear in a puff of smoke, we are led to rethink our zeal. After the end of 15 minutes as we stare at the tall statue of the astronaut, we are led to think what have they actually accomplished?

81. > **Django Unchained | Quentin Tarantino | 2012**    

_Django Unchained_ is a Western action film by and follows Django, initially a black slave in a pre-Civil war USA in the South and his subsequent rise, through a fortuitous turn of events, to become a formidable bounty hunter. It is also a dark and serious commentary on the ill-treatment of blacks by the whites. Never has such passion erupted in my heart as watching the atrocities meted out to the blacks in this film as any other. It has been a fastastic experience (which QT film isn't?). Scenes with suspense are so exceptionally composed, one might mistake to not be watching them but actually be in it. There was a tension between the whites and the blacks back in the 1850s. It is the same tension that Tarantino manages to weave into his scenes that lends gravity to the story. (For eg; Periodic pistol-clocking by Django under the table.)     

Django is an exceptional character in its own right. A talented shooter who has a formidable level of confidence and grit. One of the good Western's out there. (Oh I know, I should finally move my ass to watching _The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly_ but oh well).
