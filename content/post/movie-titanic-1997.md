Titanic is a story of two lovers, a study in human psychology, a smack down on the aristocratic bourgeois, an tantalizing crush on the pride of human marvels, and of course a tragic story retold - all in the most dramatic, enrapturing and brilliant cinematography.  

## story of two lovers

I remember the night I first saw Titanic, I just couldn't get the image of Rose out of my head. I remember being blown off by feet (figuratively) the first time Cameron zoom in on her - red hair, milky white skin with delicate pink on the cheek, parted succulent lips, marine blue eyes, a ravishing face - clad in corset and ______, sporting her hat with confidence, speaking with authority and softness - the portrait of a classic English woman / Victorian woman.


## aristocracy.

Oh god where do I begin? The first half of the movie contrasts the lives of first-class and third-class passengers onboard the Titanic which is a genius instrument employed to highlight how the same bureaucrats and aristocrats are skimpering and rattling like rats for their wasted lives. Their every action measured and planned, forced and unhearted. The women chatting in a particular manner, the men crashing on brandy and cigars talking nuisance,

Culvert having the worthless courage to say, "The better half" when Rose says only half the people onboard can be saved. Oh and this genuine scum bag. Shouting at rose, slapping her, abusing her, bribing the officer, using a little child to get on the lifeboats (I mean come on, have some guts). (I admit I'm writing this post partly to let out my rage and shout and insult this crap of a wimp to my heart's content).

The movie is rife with instances of bureaucratic mundanities. (Wasteful dinner, ...)
The most magnificent example of irony was when the cranky old bureaucrat came down from his house in the best of his suit, donning a round hat refusing to wear his life jacket lest his suit gets dirty, sitting down and coolly asking for brandy while literally half the ship is underwater. Are these people really so numb and detached from reality by all the drugs, drinks and humping that they do?

## a study in human psychology
