Tom Hamilton's familiar bass notes kick in, followed by Steven Tyler's chorus of 'Sweeeet Emooootion'. A montage of high school students, smoking, chatting casually. And then, it is declared in bold, "The last day of school, May 28 1976, 1:05 pm". The protagonists, a web of school friends, are introduced, all caught up in their own worlds.

The bell rings, boys and girls rushing out of their classes, salvaging, ransacking their lockers, throwing away paper, tearing down books to the lyrics of "School's out for summer. School out forever. School's been blown to pieces", "". Boys designing smoking devices and spanking bats while the teacher peacefully snores in woodworks class.

Richard Linklater's storytelling and the ability to convey deeper, unspeakable conflicts merely through action and simple words shines through. This is a no-holds bar portrayal of the life of American teenagers in the 70s. (And man, let me add contrary to what I thought, it's awful).

Bullying. Marijuana. Beer. Sex. Slangs. Fistfights. That is a sufficient summary of the movie. But under this cover, lies the true story that is told. One of carefree and reckless living, crushing of dreams for peers and drugs, humiliation, acceptance, and at the center of it all, the teeming and frothing teenage angst.  

The explicit portrayal of bullying of juniors is shocking yet not despised. The boys target juniors for spanking. At one point, when the senior girls are spreading ketchup and flour and cracking eggs on junior girls, Mike says, "They have permission to use the parking lot. No parents seem to mind ". Of course, it's all for fun and when it's over, surprisingly, the seniors offer them ride home, invite them to parties.  

Dawson and his gang picking up trash cans, breaking mailboxes and crushing windscreens. Unruly and reckless. They even got in trouble when caught by a mailbox owner who shot at them. 


The philosophy: 
Life is preparation for death. All we are taught to do is preparation. Since we'll be dying anyway, shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now?

### Randall 'Pink' Floyd   

Randall 'Pink' Floyd, a promising footballer, is asked to sign an agreement barring him from drugs, smoking and other illegal activities. His coach makes him aware of his potential and asks him to focus on his career. Through the night, he is trying to make up his mind, advised by his peer, Benny to let all pride rest and accept the opportunity. Simulatenously, being sermoned by aimless friends like, Slater and Wooderson on the topic of _'livin'_. At dawn, Pink, caught in this crossroads decides to pursue his friends instead of his dreams.    

Such myopic, seld-depreciative view of one's life is commonplace among teenagers and how such crucial junctures of life can be taken for granted and squandered.
