I am at a most ironical juncture of my life. At one hand, there are all these people constantly questioning me about my identity, my aspirations, _my worth_. What I want to do? _What I want to be?_ And on the other, here I am struggling to figure out what exactly am I.     

I am re-reading "A Thousand Splendid Suns" by Khaled Hosseini. I like to poke around until I can appreciate the whole picture myself. So, I was reading a Wikipedia article on Afghanistan's history. I found it interesting. And included 3 books on Afghan history in my library &ndash; looking forward to "A Brief History of Afghanistan" by Shaista Wahab et. al.  

I want to go to Afghanistan. Stand and take a deep breath of Afghani air and remember the greatness and the massacre. Remember all the great leaders, the corrupt dictators, the murders, the rapes, the genocide, the bullets, the bombs, the cries. I want to experience the sweetness of the land, the beautiful mountains, the pretty women, the hopeful youth. I want to savour the delicacies, the smells, the sounds.

And I want to learn, not only from books but from life itself. Yes, that is what I want to do.

I find everything so interesting. I find life so worthy of living. Is there anyone out there who can hear my cry? Who knows exactly how I feel?
