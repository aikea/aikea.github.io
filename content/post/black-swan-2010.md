## Central Theme

The central theme of Black swan is the exploration of human nature. Following Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or BS2, there is a well defined central dilemma followed by an all-is-lost phase which gives rise to the fundamental transformation in the protagonist. The movie, more specifically, explores true passion for something and the ability to forego one's identity for it.    

## My interpretation


The movie follows Nina Sayers, a delicate ballerina who is the embodiment of perfection. She achieves that purity by being strictly disciplined not allowing the vanities of life to touch her. So, when she must play the seductive (and evil?) Black Swan to become the Swan Queen, will she shun the opportunity or change herself completely in the process?   

The movie is the narration of that transformation. Portrayed beautifully in Aronofsky's signature style, he captures with sincerity the conflict within Nina's heart. With liberal use of CGI, the movie felt natural but not artificial. Portman was expressive enough to make you keep your eyes on her making the details only complementary.   

The story of the swans go as follows: A girl in love turns into a white swan. She must make love to become free from the form of the beast. However, the black swan steals her lover and in the end, the white swan kills herself to be free (Tell me if I got this wrong).    

Beginning with Nina's hallucinations and biting the company owner's lips, she gradually undergoes many changes, the conflicts between the pure white swan in her and the seductive Black swan trying to break free. She becomes more familiar with her body, going out with her competitor to a bar to fantasizing about her, to injuring her mother and to embracing the owner. She is the mind which begins to accept that one must be a bit of imperfect to be perfect.    

The climax was a befitting one (and IMO, a necessary one) to confer the final dash of reality. The white swan realizes that freedom can be achieved by death alone and so does Nina. The last performance was real in a more real way.    

## Conclusion

An interesting watch. Ever since [Requiem][0], I have been curious about Darren's works. Of course, the movie itself is a metaphor (all movies are) but the ideas they inject in society is significant and more important is how the majority assimilate it. In that sense, Black Swan has done a good job.
