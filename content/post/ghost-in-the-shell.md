Identity of Major Kusunagi unclear. Unclear her origins. Whether human at some point in past or not. All we have are very few dialogues. 


budget: $20M 
box office: $9.8M

Some movies are made just because some stories need to be told even if its understood by few people in its time. Such movies are timeless.

Long rambling and philosophical speeches about life, computers, and the ever-thinning  divide between consciousness and digital. Oshii leveraged the characters to comment amply about the state of society and phophesise where it was going (or where he thinks its going). 

piece of art really. visuals. dirty back alleys against tall skyscrapers. neon yellow tunnels. gripping music. it's a neo-noir cyberpunk thriller so expect very explicit gore. like perfect blue or akira. 

not very dense or choked full of events or plot progression. yet, manages to keep one hooked.
