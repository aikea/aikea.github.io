Horror movies generally occupy that grey area between paranormal and fantasy, fueled by imagination. But what if you can bring out the horror in the reality we live in? That is what Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" is about and more.   

<!--more-->
A pyschological thriller telling an intertwined story drug abuse of four connected characters, it is as relevant today as it was 20 years ago.   

## Cinematography  

A number of diverse techniques were used in the film, which coupled with the grandoise tragic soundtrack by Clint Mansell (listen to [Lux Aeterna][lux] to descend into the mood of requiem) produces an effect which promises to last for a long time.

The signature technique is probably the quick shot sequences (also called "hip hop montages"), shot in quick succession of frames to express thrill. Take the drug injecting sequence which is fantastically potrayed by imageries of popping pills, click of the lighter, pushing of the plunger, flowing fluid in the veins and dilating pupils.   

The [fish lens][fishlenswiki] used to express the distorted perception of the world by an addict. It beautifully captured the deserted condition of Sara Goldfarb, the old and lonely widow weathered by amphetamine psychosis due to illicit prescription of diet-pills and personal desperation, on her visit to her doctor.   

Split screens to indicate intimacy and spontaneity. The Harry and Marion confession scene where they plan to start Marion's cloth shop thereby fulfilling Marion's dream. Or the inherent tension in the scene where Sara tries to put off temptations with the refrigerator acting as her seducer.   

The [snorricam][snorricamwiki] to promote an intimate connection with the characters. The most effective use is of course, when Marion leaves her therapist's house, calls for the elevator, leaves the elevator, and quitely walk out in the thunderstorm to barf. Few other ways to captures the pain and humiliation that well. Or the helplessness of Tyrone fleeing madly after the trifle between the mafias.   

The film also features close-ups, time-lapse photography and >2000 cuts. (average films have ~600-700 cuts)   

## Dreams

* **Sara Goldfarb** : What can be the motivation to live for a widow whose only son runs an illegal drug business unbeknowst to her? Lonely, she resorts to the television and the _dream_ of appearing on the TV and being appreciated by her friends. It is this desire that drives her to take amphetamines to loss weight and ultimately become delusive and insane. She represents the average innocent person who is consumed by the addictions of society at a devilishly sleathy pace. Be it the spam phone call or the illicit doctor bent on making some money.   

* **Harry Goldfarb** : Harry most explicitly declares his dream with the line, "You are beautiful. You're the most beautiful girl in the world. You're my dream". The young and beautiful couple form the heart of the film (If we let Sara be the workhose) and it is the eventual brutal breakdown of their relationship that lends the grosteque tone to the film, with Harry forcing Marion into prostitution to procure money for their drug needs.   

* **Marion Silver** : She is the girl with a potential who jeopardizes herself as a result of wrong decisions in younger times. She and Harry are typical youths completely foiled in first love, thrill and of course, drugs.  

Both of them become progressively dependent on drugs even for menial emotional needs such as not breaking down or overcoming body shaming.

* **Tyrone S. Love** : He merely wanted to be worthy in the eyes of her mother.

## My impression  

I think some movies just stand out and become as timeless as fairy-tales. No doubt, Requeim has become a brutal one in the course of time. But for good reasons. I think it's one of those movies, right up there along with "Shawshank Redemption" and "Pursuit of Happyness". And definitely, a movie I'll adore for a great many days ahead.
