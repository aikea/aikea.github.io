It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.
Terminator (1984) (X2)
Loved it. And you do know how I absolutely crush on the 80s? Those were the times, ah.
Terminator 2 (1991) (X1)
Watched them both for the sheer cult status the Terminator series enjoy in the geek culture.</description></item><item><title>Watchlog</title><link>/wl/2020/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wl/2020/</guid><description>2020 The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) (x2) This is one cheeky, moving and relevant coming-of-age movie that every teenager should watch atleast once. I am personally indebted to this movie for introducing me to the ethereal Cocteau Twins.
Spider-Man Far from Home (2019) (x1)
Yea, I enjoy Marvel when I lose my sense of purpose in life and love to squander my time at things less important than planning the next rebellion.</description></item></channel></rss>
