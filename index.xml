Wes Anderson is a director whose works when subjected to multiple watching will be rewarding for the audience. Simply because of the sheer amount of information in each scene and shot. Stories that verge on the border of absurdity, most often comical, and seldom dark, coupled with an expansive mise-en-scene and a most peculiar camera style, Wes Anderson has created for himself a very distinctive style, one that is truly his own.</description></item><item><title>Playtime: A satire on corporates and capitalism</title><link>/post/movie-playtime-1967/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 14:54:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/movie-playtime-1967/</guid><description>Playtime (1967) - Jacques Tati
Playtime is unlike any other movie I have seen. It manages to be a quirky, slapstick-esque, satirical tale of a modern technological urban Paris. It follows a retired army man, Mr. Hulot (Jacques Tati) who, befuddled by perfect matchbox office skyscrapers and machine-controlled offices, eventually gets lost and ends up in a premium restaurant. There is a subplot running parallel with it that follows Ms.</description></item><item><title>2021</title><link>/wl/2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 12:08:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>/wl/2021/</guid><description>2021 Jojo Rabbit (2019) (x1) Now as I am writing this, I wonder why have I watched this only once?(!) It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.
Terminator (1984) (X2)
Loved it. And you do know how I absolutely crush on the 80s? Those were the times, ah.
Terminator 2 (1991) (X1)
Watched them both for the sheer cult status the Terminator series enjoy in the geek culture.</description></item><item><title>The joy of 'Back to the Future'</title><link>/post/movie-bttf-1985/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 10:08:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/movie-bttf-1985/</guid><description>Ah, those good ol 80s time. When everything was simple and sweet. Story-writers wrote simple stories, with simple dialogues and simple action, when the sheer simplicity of the characters made them memorable. How one started with a premise, built it to a conflict and then marvellously resolved it.

Robert Zemeckis&amp;rsquo; Back to the Future is a child of that era. A coherent, brilliantly executed script where every events seems to fall in place in harmony with others.</description></item><item><title>Normal People: The complex terrain of modern relationships</title><link>/post/series-normal-people-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 19:24:26 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/series-normal-people-2020/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This is mostly a brain dump of how much I liked this series.

In an unapologetic hustle to combat monotonicity, I ended up rewatching &amp;ldquo;10 Things I Hate About You&amp;rdquo; yesternight. The rather cocky title that crowns this post was a question that sprung to my mind during that watch. I think someone said it right when they said you don&amp;rsquo;t really watch a movie the first time because your brain is all so involved in processing the actions, dialogues, props, making sense of the storyline and generally answering the question, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s it about?</description></item><item><title>'The Little Death' is more than just a sexual comedy</title><link>/post/movie-the-little-death-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:25:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/movie-the-little-death-2014/</guid><description>CAUTION: Explicit post.

At its heart, however, it is a piognant, suspenseful, ghastly, thought-provoking masterpiece that explores such delicate themes such as celebrity lifestyle, voyeurism, desire, obsession, online identity and be audacious enough to challenge denser themes as in dissocative identity disorder, mental health, nudity, rape. It is masterful in its ability to ask so many questions and leave the audience with a nagging longing for those questions to be answered.</description></item><item><title>Perfect Blue</title><link>/_watchlog/perfect-blue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/perfect-blue/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Avengers:Endgame</title><link>/_watchlog/avengers-endgame/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/avengers-endgame/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bruce Almighty</title><link>/_watchlog/bruce-almighty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/bruce-almighty/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Dark Knight Rises</title><link>/_watchlog/the-dark-knight-rises/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/the-dark-knight-rises/</guid><description>To be honest, lacked the thrill of the second movie in the trilogy, however, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad.

Following Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or BS2, there is a well defined central dilemma followed by an all-is-lost phase which gives rise to the fundamental transformation in the protagonist. The movie, more specifically, explores true passion for something and the ability to forego one&amp;rsquo;s identity for it.

&lt;p>Horror movies generally occupy that grey area between paranormal and fantasy, fueled by imagination. But what if you can bring out the horror in the reality we live in? That is what Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Requiem for a Dream&amp;rdquo; is about and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>What should you expect from this blog? This site is my journal. Expect rambling about my day-to-day business, my thoughts and interpretations of things and people around me.
I will be as true and raw as a teenager can possibly be. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll take this as a sign of my maturity to acknowledge these issues rather than my sign of weakness.
Who am I? 🐹 Hi there!
I am a boy.</description></item><item><title>Black Swan</title><link>/_watchlog/black-swan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/black-swan/</guid><description>Yet another of Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s works. It was much better than &amp;ldquo;The Fountain&amp;rdquo; (rolling my eyes!). It didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint.

It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic, modern satire on the outside with a warm, humane story at its core. Also, my introduction to the quirky Taika Waititi.</description></item><item><title>Sherlock (BBC)</title><link>/_watchlog/sherlock/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/sherlock/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Terminator</title><link>/_watchlog/terminator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/terminator/</guid><description>Loved it.

Though, I may not watch the later ones. Besides, I believe Cameron sufficiently messes up the timeline by the end of T2. 🤷‍♂️</description></item><item><title>The Lion King</title><link>/_watchlog/the-lion-king/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/_watchlog/the-lion-king/</guid><description>A nice cozy kid&amp;rsquo;s movie with substantial life skill sermons.

After watching the trailer on YouTube, I grabbed the book by A. Adiga and then to catch this adaptation starring a fitting Adarsh Grover as Balram Halwai.

Inspite of promising myself that I would focus solely on college exam preparation and academics in general, I have given into my temptation and desire. (When I now introspect, I realize I have wasted a lot of time doing everything except academics.)
I am a big organization freak and turn insane easily if I find any part of my life going undocumented. (This is one of the primary motivations for this blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
