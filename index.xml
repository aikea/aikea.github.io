At its heart, however, it is a piognant, suspenseful, ghastly, thought-provoking masterpiece that explores such delicate themes such as celebrity lifestyle, voyeurism, desire, obsession, online identity and be audacious enough to challenge denser themes as in dissocative identity disorder, mental health, nudity, rape.

That is what Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Requiem for a Dream&amp;rdquo; is about and more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
