When everything was simple and sweet. Story-writers wrote simple stories, with simple dialogues and simple action, when the sheer simplicity of the characters made them memorable.

Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is a child of that era. A coherent, brilliantly executed script where every events seems to fall in place in harmony with others.</description></item><item><title>Titanic â€“ A study in human psychology</title><link>/post/movie-titanic-1997/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 09:29:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/movie-titanic-1997/</guid><description>Titanic is a story of two lovers, a study in human psychology, a smack down on the aristocratic bourgeois, an tantalizing crush on the pride of human marvels, and of course a tragic history retold - all in dramatic, enrapturing and brilliant cinematography.

In an unapologetic hustle to combat monotonicity, I ended up rewatching &amp;ldquo;10 Things I Hate About You&amp;rdquo; yesternight. The rather cocky title that crowns this post was a question that sprung to my mind during that watch. I think someone said it right when they said you don&amp;rsquo;t really watch a movie the first time because your brain is all so involved in processing the actions, dialogues, props, making sense of the storyline and generally answering the question, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s it about?</description></item><item><title>'The Little Death' is more than just a sexual comedy</title><link>/post/movie-the-little-death-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:25:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/movie-the-little-death-2014/</guid><description>CAUTION: Explicit post.

Tom Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s familiar bass notes kick in, followed by Steven Tyler&amp;rsquo;s chorus of &amp;lsquo;Sweeeet Emooootion&amp;rsquo;. A montage of high school students, smoking, chatting casually. And then, it is declared in bold,

At its heart, however, it is a piognant, suspenseful, ghastly, thought-provoking masterpiece that explores such delicate themes such as celebrity lifestyle, voyeurism, desire, obsession, online identity and be audacious enough to challenge denser themes as in dissocative identity disorder, mental health, nudity, rape. It is masterful in its ability to ask so many questions and leave the audience with a nagging longing for those questions to be answered.</description></item><item><title>Black Swan (2010)</title><link>/post/black-swan-2010/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/black-swan-2010/</guid><description>Central Theme Spoilers Ahead. Proceed at your discretion. The central theme of Black swan is the exploration of human nature. Following Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or BS2, there is a well defined central dilemma followed by an all-is-lost phase which gives rise to the fundamental transformation in the protagonist. The movie, more specifically, explores true passion for something and the ability to forego one&amp;rsquo;s identity for it.
My interpretation The movie follows Nina Sayers, a delicate ballerina who is the embodiment of perfection.</description></item><item><title>Why 'Requiem For A Dream' is a melancholic masterpiece</title><link>/post/requiem-for-a-dream-2000/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/requiem-for-a-dream-2000/</guid><description>&lt;div class="sm col background-warning">

That is what Darren Aronofsky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Requiem for a Dream&amp;rdquo; is about and more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
